<h2>A WORD TO YOU</h2>


<p>Submarine! It’s a word that’s in everybody’s mind—on
every one’s tongue.</p>

<p>The very sound of it conjures up thoughts of great
ships that were and will be torpedoed and sent to the
bottom of the old ocean to rust and to rot there.</p>

<p>Of all the mighty monsters that ever sailed the seven
seas this piratical craft is by long odds the most daring
as well as the most dangerous to both life and property.</p>

<p>And yet while of course you know that a submarine
can travel on or under the water, dive like a
porpoise and destroy an enemy ship by shooting a
torpedo at her, do you know exactly how an undersea
boat works and fights and just how she does all the
seemingly impossible feats for which she is notorious?</p>

<p>At the present time the greatest war in the world’s
history is being fought, and you are more than a mere
looker-on for your country is in it and you may be
one of the boys who will be called to the colors to
defend her on, or against, these undersea craft.</p>

<p>If for no other reason than this you ought to follow
not only the battles as they are being fought on
the east and west fronts of Europe, but the warfare
that is being waged by the submarines on the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
seas, for on these boats hinges to a very large extent
the outcome of the war.</p>

<p>Ever since the year of 1900 when five of the first
really successful submarines were built in the United
States and sent to England the value of this kind of
war-craft has gone forward by leaps and bounds as
the devices for operating them were more and more
improved.</p>

<p>Further too the submarine has played a far larger
part in the war that is now going on than the wildest
fancies of her inventors of twenty years ago could
have pictured, much less believed, and what is of even
greater import she bids fair to become the champion
fighter of the sea in the future.</p>

<p>Indeed so wonderful is the submarine and so great
are her possibilities that you should by all means know
exactly how she is made and works, as well as her
torpedoes. The easiest and certainly the most interesting
way to find out these things is to read this
book and then build a model submarine and torpedo
according to the simple directions we have given.</p>

<p>To open the covers of this book and to read it is the
next thing to going through the hatch in the bridge
of the conning tower and examining the mechanism at
first hand. So do it now.</p>

<small>THE FIRST OF THE SUBMARINES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> outcome of the great war that is now being
waged in Europe hinges largely on the ability of the
Central Powers<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to sink the ships of the Allies<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by
means of <i>submarines</i>, and of the Allies to destroy the
enemy <i>U-boats</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as the German submarines are commonly
called.</p>

<p>Now, while a U-boat is a submarine, all submarines
are not U-boats; for the word <i>submarine</i> means any
and everything that lives, is done, or works beneath
the surface of the sea. Thus, a fish is a submarine, and
so is a boy while he is under water—though his clothes
may be on the shore.</p>

<p><b>How the Submarine Came to Be.</b>—Yes, the fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of the <i>Paleozoic</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> era, see <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, was the earliest
submarine, in that it moved in and through the water
under its own power, and that was millions of years
before the human race and the monkey tribe branched
off from a common ancestor.</p>

THE WATERS OF THE EARTH.</div>
</div>

<p>Not only has the shape of the fish—or <i>ichthyoid
form</i>, as it is called—served as a model for inventors
of the submarine boat to go by, but the air-bladder in
the fish, which aids it in keeping its place below the
surface of the water, finds its counterpart in the ballast
tanks of the modern submarine.</p>

<p>When the first real boy parted from his monkey
cousin—that is, when the boy came down from his
tree-top house and left the monkey up there to eat a
banana all alone—Nature had fitted him with long
legs and flat feet so that he might swiftly run away
from his enemies on land.</p>

<p>But in those days when the earth was young there
were not only gigantic, long-necked animals with
cross-cut saw tails and cunning little heads, but terrifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
winged lizards<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> flew around everywhere like
airplanes do now, and monstrous and inconceivable
things swam in the sea. He could easily outwit and
outdistance his animal foes on land, but he could not
fly away from those that sailed the air, nor could he
venture far into the water for fear of his aquatic enemies.
But he learned to swim in spite of them and
when he could dive down here and come up over there
he became the second submarine. (See <a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>.)</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_2"></a>FIG. 2. THE SECOND SUBMARINE. HE WAS THE FIRST HUMAN
BEING TO PROPEL HIMSELF THROUGH THE WATER.</div>
</div>

<p>From the time he learned to swim and grew to be
a man he nursed the idea of making some kind of
device that he could get into and swim about with,
not only so that he might be protected from the monsters
that sought him as food but that he might destroy
them as well.</p>

<p>And even after all the prehistoric beasts became extinct
and so were no more on the face of the earth to
menace his safety, he still kept thinking over the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the submarine, and it kept getting stronger within
him as the <i>convolutions</i> of his brain grew deeper.</p>

<p><b>The Development of the Submarine.</b>—By hard
thinking and long experimenting, and the other way
about, and always working to the end that he might invent
some kind of boat by which he could travel under
and through the water (or, as the French have it, <i>sous
marin</i>—<i>sous</i> meaning <i>under</i> and, of course <i>marin</i>
means <i>sea</i>) like the swiftest of fish and quite as easily.</p>

<p>His reason for wanting a submarine boat now that
the animals he had so feared in the past had disappeared,
was to find treasure ships that had sunk to the
bottom of the old ocean, or, more likely because it
seemed more practical, to attack, unseen and without
warning, merchantmen that carried precious cargoes—in
a word, he would a submarine pirate be.</p>

<p>But like everything else that needs mechanical devices
and electrical apparatus the development of the
submarine from the first crude attempts to the powerful
and perfectly controlled U-boat as we know it to
our sorrow to-day took many men working through
many years to make it sea-worthy and practical.</p>

<p>In each one of these inventors the thought that ruled
him was to make a boat which would sink or swim, as
he wanted it to; and though none of the earlier workers
succeeded in building a really good submarine, it
was not their fault but their misfortune, for the vital
mechanical and electrical appliances they needed had
yet to be invented.</p>

<p>But the efforts of each one of these pioneers served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as a stepping-stone to the building of the first practical
boat, in 1901, which could be used successfully as an
undersea destroyer. This was the <i>Holland</i>, which
you will read more about presently; and the British
Admiralty purchased five of the first ones built.</p>

<p><b>The First Submarine Boat.</b>—Away back there
in the very year when the Pilgrims landed from the
<i>Mayflower</i> on Plymouth Rock—that is to say, in 1620—a
Dutchman named Van Drebel, who happened to
be living at that time in England, worked out the idea
that originated in the brain of his prehistoric ancestor,
and that was to build a submarine boat.</p>

<p>Of course in those days there were no such things
as steel boats, nor had engines to propel them been
invented, but men were adept builders of wooden boats
and, as much or more to their credit, they were past
masters of the art of sailing them.</p>

<p>But the lack of steel, of engines, and of other recent
inventions didn’t daunt the dauntless Van Drebel
in the least; for he went right ahead and built his underwater
craft of such materials as he could get hold
of. His submarine was nothing more nor less than a
regular wooden boat which was completely decked
over, covered with leather, and smeared with tallow
to make it watertight.</p>

<p>The submarine was propelled through the water by
means of a pair of oars on each side as shown in <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>,
very much in the same fashion as were the far-famed
Grecian galleys of old; but in this boat the oars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
passed through watertight flexible covers fastened over
the portholes.</p>

<p>A hollow mast was <i>stepped</i> into the deck to supply
air to the crew when the submarine was under water,
and it was also used to spread a little canvas on when
the boat was running afloat and the wind was good.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_3"></a>FIG. 3. VAN DREBEL’S SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, you may think this submarine of Van Drebel’s
was a mighty crude attempt, and no one will say
you nay, but just bear in mind, please, that it was the
<i>granddaddy</i> of the modern submarine and that it
traveled submerged down the Thames River, carrying
in it no less a personage than King James the First,
and covering a distance of seven miles from Westminster
to Greenwich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>After this first and very successful attempt at submarine
building it was not long until others began to
make improvements and to build underwater boats
which would outdo the spectacular performance of
Van Drebel’s submarine. It ought to send a thrill
of pleasure through you to know that most of these
inventors were Americans, but in your feeling of pride
don’t forget that the oversea workers along submarine
lines followed closely on the heels of our own in
ingenuity, building, and operative ability.</p>

<p><b>A Submarine of the Revolution.</b>—The first submarine
designed to destroy enemy ships was invented
and built by an American named David Bushnell, just
about the time that Liberty Bell was ringing out the
Independence of the United States.</p>

<p>His submarine, had it not been for an accident, and
of which I will tell you later, would now be exploited
in every school history of our country. But even the
accident showed that the submarine had great inherent
possibilities and dynamic power stored up in it which
warring nations of the future must reckon with.</p>

<p>Different from all past ideas and present conceptions
of submarines, and far removed from any design
which is ordinarily thought of in connection with boats,
Bushnell’s submarine, instead of going through the
water with its <i>long axis</i> horizontal to the top, moved
through it vertically.</p>

<p>The way in which this strange craft was <i>submerged</i>—that
is, sunk—is <i>fundamental</i>, which means that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
is the simple, natural way and the one that is used in all
submarines that have been built since then.</p>

<p>A number of empty tanks were so fixed in the vessel
that when the pilot wanted to submerge it he could
let the water into them, and when he wanted to rise to
the surface again he could pump the water out with a
hand force-pump. This scheme is used in all of the
submarine boats of the present time, though of course
the pumps are power-driven.</p>

<p>A heavy weight that could be detached was fixed
to the bottom of the craft, which helped it to maintain
its upright position and also aided in submerging it.
In case an accident happened to the pumps the weight
could be released, when the craft would come to the
surface.</p>

<p>Another good feature of this submarine was the
valves which let fresh air into the vessel when it
floated on top of the water but which closed <i>automatically</i>—that
is, without the help of the pilot—when the
submarine sank below the water line.</p>

<p>The way the first submarine of Bushnells was driven
was just as primitive as the one built by Van Drebel;
indeed, it was a shade worse, for a solitary oar sticking
through the rear end of the shell provided the
means for going ahead while another oar on one side
helped to raise and lower it.</p>

<p>He later designed, built, and successfully operated
another submarine, which was far superior to his
first model. It had the same shape as his first one
but it was propelled by two screws which were turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by <i>hand</i>; one of these moved the submarine forward
and backward through the water, and the other one
moved it up and down—all of which is clearly shown
in <a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>. Hence the credit for the invention of the
screw-driven submarine belongs to Bushnell.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_4"></a>FIG. 4. BUSHNELL’S SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p><b>The First Torpedo Fired by a Submarine.</b>—Bushnell,
though, did more than to invent a workable
submarine, for he also devised and used a <i>torpedo</i>; or
it would be better to call it a <i>bomb</i>, since it was <i>timed</i>
to explode by clock-work, instead of by <i>concussion</i>.
He intended to hang this submarine bomb on the bottom
of an enemy ship—and thereby hangs a tale.</p>

<p>The British man-of-war <i>Eagle</i> had anchored in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
York Harbor close to Staten Island sometime in the
famous year of 1776.</p>

<p>The inventor was a patriot and offered his services
and the use of his submarine to the new United States
Government; the latter accepted them and ordered him
to blow up the warship. As the inventor became sick
he gave a sergeant, named Lee, the honor of using his
submarine and blowing up the ship. Lee worked the
submarine without a hitch until he reached the man-of-war,
and then his troubles began.</p>

<p>Try as he would, he could not drive the screw into
the tough English oak of which the hull of the ship
was made, and this he must needs do in order to fasten
the bomb to the bottom of it.</p>

<p>Finally, just as the clock-work of the torpedo was
about to explode it, he set it adrift, and the young
officer made off just in time to save himself. As it
was, the bomb exploded close to the stern of the boat,
but it did not do any serious damage.</p>

<p><b>Robert Fulton’s Submarine.</b>—About the year
1800, Robert Fulton, the Famous American inventor,
who built the first successful steamboat, designed and
built a submarine that was far ahead of either of those
I have just described.</p>

<p>It was cigar-shaped, to begin with, and this lessened
the resistance it offered to the water, and it was fitted
with a keel, a rudder, a propeller, and a <i>conning tower</i>,
so that the pilot could see where he was going. Fulton
did not attempt, though, to use a steam engine to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the propeller, but turned it by hand. His submarine
is shown in <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>Another big improvement that Fulton made was to
cover the hull of his submarine with copper plates.
Taken altogether it came as near being a real submarine
as could have been made with the materials and
inventions which were available at that time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="472" height="251" alt="another early sub" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_5"></a>FIG. 5 FULTON’S SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p>After offering his submarine to the French, British,
and American Governments in turn, and after it was
<i>turned down</i> by all of them because they failed to see
in it a useful weapon of war, Fulton turned his
thoughts toward home and craft of a more peaceful
nature.</p>

<p>Had any one of these governments been able to see
the wonderful possibilities of the undersea craft that
Fulton had so greatly improved upon, the submarine
would have been perfected long before it was.</p>

<p>Fulton’s remarkable experiment, with his <i>Nautilus</i>,
as he called his boat, on the Seine River, which flows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
through Paris, attracted much attention, and a plan
was set on foot to use his submarine to rescue the
exiled Napoleon from the Island of St. Helena. Again
Fulton was doomed to disappointment, for the Great
Emperor died before the scheme could be carried out.</p>

<p>It was then that Fulton returned to the United
States and set about the more peaceful task of building
a steam propelled river boat, or <i>steam boat</i> as it
is called, and which won for him much money and undying
fame.</p>

<p><b>The Earliest Steam Propelled Submarine.</b>—It
was eighty years after Fulton made his classic underwater
experiments that Garrett, an English inventor,
designed, built, and operated a submarine which used
steam as its source of power.</p>

<p>This later submarine had all the good features of
Fulton’s craft, besides the history-making improvement
of using a steam engine to drive her—not only
when she was afloat but when she was submerged as
well.</p>

<p>The way it was done was like this: a regular boiler
was set in the boat and this had a telescopic <i>funnel</i>,
as a ship’s smoke-stack is called. When running on the
surface the water in the boiler was changed into steam
and the smoke poured out of the funnel. But when
the craft was submerged, the funnel was drawn under
the deck, the fire doors, which were made air tight,
were closed, and the steam pressure already generated
in the boiler was high enough to run the boat for several
miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Coming of the Torpedo-Tube Submarine.</b>—Clear
up to the time of the <i>Centennial Exposition</i> held
at Philadelphia in 1876, the only idea that inventors
of submarines seem to have had was to use a bomb
of some sort which could be attached to the submerged
hull of an enemy ship and which would
blow her up.</p>

<p>This crude scheme, as you have seen, was not only
uncertain but it was at once a difficult piece of work
and very dangerous to the operator. About this time,
or perhaps a little later, a Swedish engineer, named
Nordenfelt, invented a torpedo which could be shot
from a tube in the head of the submarine.</p>

<p>His early submarine had a length of 100 feet and
could make 12 <i>knots</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on top of the water; she could be
submerged to a depth of about 50 feet, when, of
course, her speed was considerably reduced. She was
steam-driven and had two propellers.</p>

<p>But the great improvement of this submarine craft
over all the others that had been built before her was
her torpedo tubes through which torpedoes<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> could
be shot from the inside of the boat and aimed at
the enemy. Besides the torpedoes, she carried two
rapid-fire guns, and these made her an engine of destruction
greatly to be feared. She is shown in <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Invention of the Electric Submarine.</b>—What
with the amazing uses to which electricity was
being put, it is small wonder that as soon as the storage
battery was invented and electric motor was discovered,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
inventors became imbued with the idea of using
the mighty invisible power for running their submarine
boats.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_6"></a>FIG. 6. THE NORDENFELT SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p>The first submarine to be propelled solely by electricity
was designed and built about 1886 by Campbell and
Ash, of England. The outstanding features of this
undersea craft were the storage batteries, which were
formed of 104 cells, and the electric motors, of which
there were two and each one developed 45 horsepower.</p>

<p>The boat had a speed of 6 knots, and it had a cruising
radius of 80 miles, without recharging the batteries.
She is shown in <a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a>. The electric submarine
never got out of the experimental class, because of
the imperfections of the storage battery at that early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
date and in virtue of the fact that its range of travel
was very limited.</p>

<p>But the experiments were not without value, though,
for they led to the use of electricity as the ideal power
for undersea propulsion, as you will presently learn.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_7"></a>FIG. 7. THE NAUTILUS, AN ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p><b>What the Gas Engine Did for the Submarine.</b>—Greater
effort to use electricity as a motive power
for submarines would doubtless have been made had
not the gas-engine been invented in 1888.</p>

<p>This new kind of engine was the ideal motive power
for propelling a submarine on the surface of the sea,
and at the same time it could drive a dynamo which
would generate an electric current to charge the storage
batteries with.</p>

<p>And when the boat was submerged the engine could
be stopped and there was no smoke or burnt gases to
escape; the storage battery then gave up its electric
current, this energized the motors, and these in turn
drove the propellers. This combination system of
gas and electric power is used in all submarine boats
at the present time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The first engineer to combine a gas and an electric
power plant in a submarine as described above was
Depuy de Lôme. This French engineer turned out a
wonderfully successful submarine; and this was still
further perfected by another Frenchman, named Gustave
Zédé. Many of the submarines used in the French
Navy at the present time are of the Depuy de Lôme-Zédé
type.</p>

<p><b>The Two Types of Submarines.</b>—Two American
inventors, name Lake and Holland, were working <i>independently</i>
of each other—that is, neither knew the
other was working on submarines—and each developed
a different type of undersea boat. This was about
1896.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_8"></a>FIG. 8. THE LAKE SUBMERSIBLE BOAT.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Lake Submersible.</i>—The first underwater boat
built by Simon Lake was shaped very much like
a ship. The hull was mounted on wheels, so that
it could travel on the bottom of the sea if need be,
for it was originally intended to be used by pearl divers
and oystermen.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_9"></a>FIG. 9. THE HOLLAND SUBMARINE BOAT.</div>
</div>
<p>In the early part of this chapter I told you that the
word <i>submarine</i> means anything that lives in, is done,
or works beneath the water-line of the sea. Now, in
naval engineering, <i>submarine</i> has come to mean an undersea
craft that can <i>dive</i>, while an undersea boat that
simply sinks on an even keel is called a <i>submersible</i>. So
the Lake shown in <a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8</a> is a submersible, for it is not
intended to dive.</p>

<p><i>The Holland Submarine.</i>—The Holland undersea
boat is a real submarine, for it can dive. The hull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of this boat looked more like a whale with its tail
twisted up than like a boat, as you will see in <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>





<p><i>The Combined Holland and Lake Types.</i>—The
shape of the Holland submarine makes it a good undersea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a><br /><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
boat; the Lake submersible has a large deck
and roomy quarters, and its shape makes it good for
surface going. The result is that naval architects
have combined the two types so that the new model
submarines have the advantages of the older types and
are without their disadvantages.</p>

<small>HOW TO MAKE AND WORK A MODEL
SUBMARINE</small></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> best way to know how a machine works is to
work with it, and the next best thing to working with
an actual machine is to work with a model which you
have made with your own hands.</p>

<p>In this way you not only will become acquainted
with the mechanism which is used to obtain a certain
result, but if you are of an inventive turn of mind
you are likely to get one or more ideas for improving
it which will be of more or less value.</p>

<p>Now, this is just what you should do with the submarine
if you really want to know the innermost secrets
of how it is made and works—that is, you should
build a model of one and experiment with it.</p>

<p>To the end that you may do this, I have given in
this chapter the <i>plans</i> and <i>specifications</i>, which mean
the working drawings and a full description, of a 2-foot
model submarine boat which you can easily make
and run yourself.</p>

<p>This model submarine is not only instructive but
it is “amoosin’,” as Artemus Ward used to say, for
while it starts out <i>awash</i>—that is, with its deck just
about level with the top of the water—it will soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
take a dive, run a ways <i>submerged</i>, and then bob up
on the surface again, just like a real submarine.</p>

<p><b>The Parts of the Model Submarine.</b>—There are
only four chief parts to this model, and these are (1)
the <i>hull</i>; (2) the <i>ballast tank</i>; (3) the <i>power plant</i>;
and (14) the <i>superstructure</i>. All of this is shown in
Fig 11.</p>

<p>The hull is of course the body of the boat. The
ballast tank is a tin can in the bottom of the hull;
when it is filled with water the extra weight makes the
boat sink, and when the water is blown out of it by
compressed air it makes the boat rise to the surface
again.</p>

<p>The power plant includes an electric motor, the batteries
to run it, the propeller-shaft and propeller, the
pulleys which work the valve that lets the compressed
air flow into the ballast tank to blow out the water, and
finally the superstructure, which consists of the deck
and the conning tower, though in this case the latter
is made to hold the compressed air.</p>

<p><b>The Hull of the Boat.</b>—The first thing to do is
to make the hull; and the easiest way to build one that
is light, strong, and watertight is to whittle out, or have
sawed out, two tapering pieces of wood as shown at
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12</a>. The faces are shown by the dotted
lines at <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> in Fig 11.</p>

<p>These are for the nose and tail blocks, as we will
call them, and each one is 14½ inches long. The
other dimensions, as well as the shapes of these blocks,
are also shown in <a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Bore four ⅛-inch holes, ¾ inch deep in the <i>faces</i>—that
is, the flat ends of each block—at the places
shown by the little circles; these are to take in the
ends of the <i>brace rods</i>. Next bore a ¼-inch hole
lengthwise through the tail block as shown by the
dotted lines at <i>B</i>. Bore out this hole with a 1-inch
bit to a depth of ¾ inch, to form a <i>stuffing box</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_12"></a>FIG. 12. THE NOSE AND TAIL BLOCKS.</div>
</div>

<p>Now cut off a piece of brass tube which has an inside
diameter of ⅛ inch and an outside diameter of
¼ inch and force it into the hole in the tail block;
this tube forms the bearing for the propeller-shaft.</p>

<p>Cut out a disk of brass 1¼ inches in diameter and
<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></small> inch thick; drill a ⅛-inch hole through the center
of it for the propeller-shaft to pass through, and
three ⅛-inch holes at equal distances apart near the
edge, as shown at <i>C</i>, so that it can be screwed to the
tail block. The purpose of this disk is to keep the
<i>packing</i> in the stuffing box. See <a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The next thing to do is to cut off two brass rods each
⅛ inch in diameter and 16½ inches long and fit the
ends of these into the lower holes in the blocks; and
then cut off two more brass rods 17 inches long and
set these into the upper holes. Bend these latter rods
out a little until the faces of the blocks are parallel
with each other, and you will have a substantial
framework on which to fasten the <i>skin</i> of the hull.</p>

<p>The skin, as the sheets or plates which form the hull
are called, is made of sheet tin, and to cut the tin you
should have a pair of tinner’s shears.</p>

<p>You will need seven strips of tin altogether: one for
the bottom and three for each side. The sizes and
shapes of these strips are shown in <a href="#FIG_13">Fig. 13</a>. The widest
strip is used for the bottom of the hull; bend up
the edges along the dotted lines, then punch eight holes
in the ends—these are shown by the little crosses—and
screw it to the nose and tail blocks with flat-headed
wood screws.</p>

<p>Next punch holes in and screw one of the lower
strips to each side of the nose and tail blocks, with the
hollow curved edge down and lapped over the turned-up
edge of the bottom strip; punch and screw on each
of the middle strips, with its lower hollow curved edge
over the top of each of the lower strips; and then
punch and screw on the top strips.</p>

<p>When you have the bottom and all of the side strips
screwed on, each one will lap over the next lower
one ½ inch and fit snugly up to it, and at the same
time they will all curve gracefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_13"></a>FIG. 13. THE STRIPS WHICH FORM THE SKIN OF THE HULL.</div>
</div>

<p>After you have these strips screwed on, you must
solder the lap seams to make them watertight. You
can easily do this by using a regular tinner’s soldering
copper—a soldering fluid made by dissolving zinc clippings
in some dilute <i>muriatic acid</i>—and what is called
<i>wire solder</i>.</p>

<p>The cover of the boat, or <i>deck</i>, to give it its nautical
name, is a part of the superstructure, and you can
cut this out later on.</p>

<p><b>The Ballast Tank.</b>—The sole purpose of the ballast
tank is to add enough weight to the boat to sink
it when you want it to sink.</p>

<p>Use heavy sheet tin for the tank. Cut out two strips,
each of which is 2 inches wide and 15½ inches long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Make a ½-inch lap seam and solder the ends of this
strip together, making one strip 30 inches long. Bend
the strip so that each side is 11 inches long and the
ends are 3½ inches long; this will bring the ends together,
forming another ½-inch lap seam, and this,
of course, you must also solder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<a href="images/i_029-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="465" height="301" alt="diagrams" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_14"></a>FIG. 14. HOW THE BALLAST TANK IS MADE.</div>
</div>

<p>Cut out a top and a bottom, each 4 inches wide and
11½ inches long. Cut the corners; bend up the edges
¼ inch all round, and solder the corners. And don’t
be afraid to use plenty of solder, for this tank must be
strong, and not only watertight but airtight as well.</p>

<p>About 4 inches from one end of the bottom sheet
cut a ½-inch hole for the <i>water inlet and outlet</i>, that
is the hole where the water flows into and out of the
tank. In this hole solder a piece of ½-inch brass pipe
½ an inch long and flush with the surface of the tin,
as shown at <i>A</i> in Fig 14; and also at <i>B</i> in <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, with a pair of dividers 1¾ inches in diameter,
<i>scribe</i> a circle which has its center 3¼ inches from
the other end of the bottom and in the middle of it.
Cut out three strips of tin ¼ inch wide and 2 inches
long—or wire will do—and bend over one end of each
one ¼ inch.</p>

<p>Solder these strips to the bottom at equal distances
around the circle as shown by the dotted line at <i>B</i> in
<a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>, and in the cross-sectional drawing <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>.
The upright strips serve as guides to keep the <i>cork
float</i> in place and yet let it move freely up and down in
the tank.</p>

<p>Cut a hole ½ inch in diameter, 2 inches from one
end of the cover, or top, of the tank as shown at <i>A</i>
in <a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>. This is for the pipe of the valve mechanism.</p>

<p>Next cut out a hole exactly ¾ inch in diameter, and
have its center 3¼ inches from the end. Take a piece
of tin and make a <i>valve seat</i> so that its small end is
<small><sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub></small> inch in diameter and solder it to the top over the
hole. This valve seat must be made with particular
care, so that it will be perfectly smooth and the <i>valve
plug</i> will fit it airtight.</p>

<p>The valve plug is a piece of cork cut in the shape
of a cone and must fit the valve seat exactly; soak it
in machine oil, then run a piece of aluminum wire 1¾
inches long through it and bend it over on the bottom
as shown at <i>C</i> in <a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14</a> and in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_15"></a>FIG. 15. THE AIR CONTROL MECHANISM AND POWER PLANT.</div>
</div>

<p>Next solder the bottom to the sides of the tank.
Drop the cork float between the upright guides as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shown at <i>B</i> in <a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>. Set the cork valve plug on the
cork float. Put on the cover with the aluminum wire
sticking up through the hole in the valve seat; and
finally solder on the cover.</p>

<p><b>The Air Control Mechanism.</b>—Since you cannot
be in your model submarine when it is stealing along
submerged through the water, you must fit an automatically
controlled air-valve in the pipe that connects
the air chamber with the ballast tank, in order to
blow out the water when it is time for the craft to
come to the surface to breathe again.</p>

<p>There are two chief parts to the air control mechanism,
and these are (1) the <i>air-valve</i>, and (2) the
<i>pusher control</i>. We will describe the air-valve and its
fittings now and tell you how the pusher control is
made and works under the next caption.</p>

<p><i>The Power Plant.</i>—The reason we have split up the
air control mechanism in this fashion is because it is
easier to solder the air supply pipe to the ballast tank
at this stage of the work than it is to do it after the
ballast tank is fixed to the bottom of the hull; again
it is easier to do the latter job before the power plant is
put in the hull; and finally the pusher control is really
a part of the power plant.</p>

<p>If you will take a good look at the cross-section
drawing, <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>, you will see that the air-valve and
its fittings consist of (a) the air-valve proper; (b) a
small piston; and (c) the connecting pipes.</p>

<p>First get four lengths of pipes<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> all of which have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
inside diameter of <small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub></small> inch; have these pipes ½, 2,
2⅜ and 2¾ inches long respectively. Thread or have
these pipes threaded as follows: the ½-inch length
threaded inside and all the way through; the 2-inch
length of pipe threaded on the inside to a depth of 1
inch from one end and a hole drilled in it ⅝ inch from
the other end, and have this threaded; the 2⅜-inch
pipe threaded on both ends and one end bent over ⅝
of an inch; and, finally, thread one end of the 2¾-inch
length of pipe.</p>

<p>Now screw the ½-inch length of pipe on the end
of the 2⅜-inch piece of pipe which has the nut and
washers on it. Screw a bicycle tire valve into the 2-inch
piece of pipe and far enough in so that the bent
end of the 2⅜-inch pipe can also be screwed in, as
shown in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>. Last of all, screw the end of the
2¾-inch pipe into the threaded hole in the wall of
the 2-inch pipe.</p>

<p>Next make a piston of a piece of brass rod ⅜ inch
long and of such diameter that it will fit snugly and yet
slide easily in the end of the 2-inch pipe. Drill a <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></small>
inch hole through the piston and fix a stem in it tight so
that it projects ¼ inch through one end and ⅜ inch
through the other end. File a grooved ring around
the piston to hold in the oil and slip the piston in the
open end of the pipe.</p>

<p>This done, clean the lower end of the long pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
well; set it into the hole in the top of the ballast tank;
use plenty of soldering fluid and solder it in good and
tight. At the time you are doing this job see to it that
the long pipe sets <i>plumb</i>—that is, perfectly straight up
and down.</p>

<p><i>Setting the Ballast Tank in the Hull.</i>—You are now
ready to set the ballast tank in the hull. To do this you
must cut a hole ½ inch in diameter, 4 inches from the
face of the nose, as shown at <i>B</i> in <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>. Set the
tank in the hull so that the pipe on the bottom of it
will stick through the hole which you have just cut;
and then solder the pipe to the hull on the outside.</p>

<p><i>Putting in the Bulkhead.</i>—As you will see from the
end views <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> in <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>, there is considerable
space between the ballast tank and the skin of the hull
on both sides.</p>

<p>As melted lead is to be poured into this space to give
the boat the right weight to make it sink properly a
<i>bulkhead</i>—that is, a partition—must be cut out of
tin and soldered to the hull, on the inside of course,
up against the rear end of the ballast tank. The face
of the wooden nose against which the ballast tank
rests will keep the lead from running out at the front
end. As the lead is poured in after the motor is set in
place this operation will be described later.</p>

<p><b>About the Power Plant.</b>—While in a real submarine
the <i>power plant</i>—the machine that converts the
fuel into power to drive the boat—is a <i>gas engine</i> when
it is cruising on the surface, and a <i>storage battery</i> and
an <i>electric motor</i> when it is running submerged, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
your model it is electricity first, last, and all the time.</p>

<p>That is to say, a battery of dry cells supplies the current
to run an electric motor and this in turn drives
the propeller; besides, it also furnishes the power
needed to work the pusher which controls the air supply
through the bicycle valve which I have just explained
to you.</p>

<p>The first thing to do toward getting the power
plant is to beg, buy, or borrow a small electric motor
which will develop not less than <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub></small> horsepower and
at the same time run on a battery of not more than
3 dry cells.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>While the motor can be run to its full capacity on
two dry cells it will develop more power on a three-cell
battery. Now, to get three dry cells which will fit
into the small space that is left in the hull of your
model you will have to use rectangular cells.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>You will also need a small switch to open and close
the battery circuit, and this is fixed to the top of the
boat, or <i>deck</i> as it is more properly called; the way it
is put on will be explained under the caption of <i>The
Superstructure</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>When you want to buy one of these switches ask for
a <i>porcelain base, single pole, single throw switch</i>. It
will cost about a quarter. The way the dry cell battery,
the motor, and the switch are connected up is shown in
<a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_16"></a>FIG. 16. HOW THE POWER PLANT IS CONNECTED UP.</div>
</div>

<p><b>The Pusher Control Device.</b>—Before the motor
is installed in the hull the pusher control device which
opens the compressed air valve must be made and
mounted on top of it.</p>

<p>On top of the motor, as you will see by looking at
<a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>, there is a metal name plate, which is fastened
to the top of the field magnets by four screws; unscrew
the latter and take off the plate.</p>

<p>Now make a <i>pillow block</i>, as the bearing for the
threaded spindle is called. Saw out with a <i>hack saw</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
a base plate of sheet brass ⅛ inch thick, 1 inch wide,
and 1½ inches long; drill four ⅛-inch holes in the
corners of the plate, so that it can be screwed down to
the field magnets of the motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Also drill two ⅛-inch holes lengthwise in the middle
of the plate and have the first one ⅛ inch from one end
and the other ½ inch from the same end and in a
line with the first hole.</p>

<p>Take a brass bar ¼ inch thick, ½ inch wide, and
1⅝ inches high, and drill two <small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>32</sub></small> inch holes in one
end of it, to correspond to the two holes in the middle
of the base plate, and thread these to fit a couple of
6-32 machine screws.</p>

<p>Next drill a ⅛-inch hole clear through the top of
the bar, or <i>standard</i>, as it is now called, <small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></small> inch
from the top. This must be <i>very accurately done</i>, in
fact, it ought to be done with a drill press, for if it is
not precisely at right angles to the base, the spindle
will not run true, and besides there will be a great loss
of power.</p>

<p>Drill a hole through the top of the standard until
it meets the hole through which the spindle is to pass,
and by means of this top hole keep the spindle well
oiled. The pillow block is shown complete in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>
and <a href="#FIG_17">17</a>.</p>

<p>To make the spindle, get a piece of soft steel rod
⅛ inch in diameter and 4½ inches long. Thread it
from one end to within 1⅜ inches of the other end,
and screw on a nut as far as it will go. Push the
smooth end through the hole in the pillow block; slip
a collar over the end close up to the standard, and
screw it fast. To make the pusher mechanism complete
put a grooved pulley 1½ inches in diameter on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the end of the spindle up close to the collar and screw
it fast.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="341" height="333" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_17"></a>FIG. 17. THE PILLOW BLOCK.</div>
</div>

<p>The last part of the pusher control is the pusher itself.
It is simply a round brass rod ¼ inch in diameter
and ¾ inch long, with a hole drilled through it
lengthwise and threaded to fit the spindle. Solder a bit
of brass near one end, to make it heavier on one side
than on the other.</p>

<p>Now, when the motor is set in place in the hull and
its small pulley is belted to the large pulley on the
spindle and the current is turned on, the spindle revolves,
but the weight on the pusher will keep it from
turning with the spindle. Instead, the curious result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is that it screws itself toward the free end of the spindle,
and when it reaches the end, the hollow pusher
goes over the stem of the piston. When it strikes the
piston it pushes on it until it presses the other end of
the stem against the pin of the bicycle valve and this
opens it.</p>

<p>If you will keep the piston, the pusher, and the
bearings well lubricated with sewing-machine oil,
there will be little power lost through undue friction.
But you must be careful not to get any oil on the <i>commutator</i>
of the motor, for this will keep it from running
properly.</p>

<p><b>The Propeller-Shaft.</b>—Before you install the
motor you must put the propeller-shaft through its
bearing in the tail block.</p>

<p>To make the propeller-shaft, get a piece of soft steel
rod ⅛ inch in diameter and 5¼ inches long and thread
it at both ends. Slip it through the tube which forms
the bearing. Soak some cotton-waste in machine oil
and pack it in the stuffing box in the tail block. Now
screw the circular plate to the face of the tail block
to keep the packing in place.</p>

<p><b>Installing the Motor.</b>—While we have given you
the height to make the pillow block, it will, of course,
depend on (1) the height of the motor, and (2) the
height of the center of the piston when both are measured
from the floor of the hull; this is because the
pusher spindle and the piston stem must be exactly in
a line with each other.</p>

<p>Another thing: The motor we have shown is 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
inches high from its base to the center of its armature
shaft; but the motor you get may not be of this height.
While it can’t be any higher than 3 inches unless you
change the design of the boat, it can be shorter if you
mount it on a block of the right thickness.</p>

<p>Before installing the motor in the boat, see that both
pulleys are in a line with each other, and put on a
belt. Thread the end of the motor-shaft and fit a
<i>coupling</i> to it so that the propeller-shaft can be screwed
into the other end. To make the coupling take a piece
of brass rod ¼ inch in diameter, <small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub></small> inch long; drill a
<small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>32</sub></small>-inch hole in it, and thread it to fit the motor- and
propeller-shafts.</p>

<p>Screw the coupling on the motor-shaft. Mount the
motor on a board of the right thickness, and set it
in position in the hull. Screw the propeller-shaft into
the coupling, and be sure to have the motor set so that
the shafts are in perfect <i>alignment</i>—that is, in a line
with each other—as shown in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>Unless this is done the propeller-shaft will bind in
its bearing and it will take a large part of the power
of your motor to overcome it. When the motor, the
pusher spindle, and the propeller-shaft all spin freely
on closing the battery circuit, you can then secure the
motor to the floor of the hull with a couple of machine
screws as shown in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ballasting the Boat.</b>—The next thing to do is
to <i>ballast</i> the boat by pouring melted lead into her hull
to make her sink deep enough in the water to balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
her and to make her submerge entirely when water is
let into her ballast tank.</p>

<p>The way to do this is to cork up the hole in the pipe
in the bottom that leads to the ballast tank and then
set the boat in a tub full of water. Now lay the battery
cells in the positions they are to occupy in the
boat, as shown at <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> in <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>, and see how
far up the water-line comes on the hull—or, in other
words, how deep the hull sinks into the water.</p>

<p>Next pour melted lead in between the sides of the
ballast tank and the hull while the boat is still in the
tub of water and distribute it so that the boat floats
on a perfectly even keel. When you have poured
enough lead into the hull to make her sink to within
an inch or so of her <i>gunwales</i> (the upper edge of the
boat’s sides) and she is nicely balanced, let the lead
cool, take the boat out of the tub and put her back
on her stocks on your bench.</p>

<p>And now a couple of parting hints: (1) You can
melt the lead in an iron ladle over a kitchen fire, and
(2) put a little water in the ballast tank so that the
hot lead will not open the soldered seams.</p>

<p><b>Making the Superstructure.</b>—This consists of the
top, or deck, and the conning tower, which in this
model serves for the compressed air tank.</p>

<p>To make the deck, cut out a sheet of heavy tin the
exact shape of and dimensions given in <a href="#FIG_18">Fig. 18</a>. Cut
a ½-inch hole half way between the ends, and in the
middle, for the air-valve pipe to pass through and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
which is screwed to the conning tower as shown in
<a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>Cut out a 2½-inch hole in the aft end of the deck
for a <i>hatch</i>, and make a cover, or hatch, for it 3½
inches in diameter; this hatch will allow you to get
your hand through the deck and into the hull to reset
the pusher device when your submarine is to make

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_18"></a>FIG. 18. HOW THE DECK IS MADE.</div>
</div>

<p>Cut out a rectangular hole ½ inch wide and 2 inches
long in the for’ard end of the deck, for the screws
and the wires of the switch to pass through. Screw
the porcelain block of the switch to a board of the
same size, with the tin deck in between them; this insulates
the screws of the switch from the tin, which
would otherwise <i>short circuit</i> the battery and run it
down. Run sealing-wax in and around the edges
of both the porcelain and wood blocks to make a watertight
joint, for water must not get into the boat.</p>

<p>This done, connect up the batteries and these with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the motor, with heavy rubber-covered copper wire,
and connect the battery and the motor with the switch
with flexible electric-light cord. Set the deck on the
hull; and if you are sure everything is in first-class
working order, solder it on tight. If, though, you are
not quite certain, you can do a temporary job by putting
it on with sealing-wax.</p>

<p>Supposing you are young enough to have imagination
or old enough to have dim vision, the switch
mounted on the deck will look very much like a gun
that is just coming through the hatch and getting
ready for action.</p>

<p><b>And Now the Conning Tower.</b>—The conning
tower is an airtight vessel—as far as your model goes—having
a conical shape.</p>

<p>To make it, scribe two circles, using the same center,
on a sheet of heavy tin, making one of them 4
inches in diameter and the other 5 inches in diameter,
and cut it out around the larger circle.</p>

<p>Cut a ½-inch hole in the center of the disk. Put
the ½-inch length of threaded pipe we told you about
under the caption of <i>The Air Control Mechanism</i> in
the hole, and solder it fast. Cut the edge of the disk
<i>radially</i> with your shears, from its edge to the
smaller scribed circle, and then you can bend up the
edge all the way round.</p>

<p>Next cut out an <i>arc</i> of tin of the size marked and
the shape shown in <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>. Make a lap seam and
solder it.</p>

<p>Scribe a 3-inch and a 4-inch circle on a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
tin and cut it out. Cut the edge radially as before,
and bend it up all the way round. Cut a ½-inch hole
near the edge of the intake air-valve pipe. Solder the
two disks to the cone and be sure the ½-inch threaded
pipe is <i>inside</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_19"></a>FIG. 19. THE WALL OF THE CONNING TOWER.</div>
</div>

<p>To complete the conning tower, get a 5- or a 7-inch
length of pipe; bend over one end a little; thread it
and screw in a bicycle valve. Finally stick the other
end of the pipe through the hole in the top of the conning
tower and solder it there, as shown in <a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>,
which also shows the conning tower complete. The
purpose of this pipe is so that you can pump air into
the tank with a bicycle, or an auto pump.</p>

<p>Bend the end of each tongue of the rudder to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a <i>knuckle</i>, and slip the knuckles over the pins. Screw
a nut on the end of each pin, and by tightening them
up you can make the rudder stay at any angle you put
it.</p>

<p><b>Painting Your Craft.</b>—You can buy a good marine
paint of almost any color you want at paint stores
generally.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Gray is the most appropriate color to paint your
model craft with; but whatever color you choose, lay
it on the long way of the boat so as not to streak it
but make a good smooth job of it. Put on three
coats and let each coat dry thoroughly before you apply
the next one. And now your submarine is done,
and if you have made a good job of it, it will look
like the half-tone cut shown here.</p>

<p><b>How to Work Your Submarine.</b>—Having everything
in readiness, take your terrible little U-boat
under your arm to the nearest lake or river.</p>

<p>Pump the conning tower full of compressed air
and then gently put her in the water. Throw on the
switch, and it will do the rest. By this, I mean that
the moment you turn on the current the motor will
drive the propeller at a goodly clip and the craft will
travel over the surface of the water awash—that is,
with the water washing over her deck.</p>

<p>At the same time, the ballast tank begins to fill with
water, and the added weight makes the boat go deeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and deeper until only the bridge<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of her conning tower
can be seen; and after a few moments more her <i>periscope</i>
(or air supply tube) sinks out of sight.</p>

<p>While she is going down the weighted pusher is
moving slowly but surely over the threaded spindle;
when it reaches the piston it pushes it against the pin
in the air-valve and so opens it and keeps it open.</p>

<p>The instant the air-valve opens, the compressed air
from the air tank (conning tower) rushes into the
ballast tank, and because it is under a high pressure
it forces the water out of the tank through the hole
whence it came in.</p>

<p>When the water has been blown out of the ballast
tank the boat is, of course, lighter, and naturally she
rises to the surface again. This is your cue to be
right there with a rowboat and get her and to pump
more air into the compressed air tank before she makes
another trip.</p>

<p>If you don’t do this and she ever goes down with
her ballast tank full of water and there is no compressed
air left to blow it out with, you can send a
censored report to the daily papers that another U-boat
has been sunk and that there was no time to save the
crew.</p>

<p>But, anyway, you will have oceans of fun with your
model, and your head will brim over with submarine
lore.</p>

<div class="faux">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>HOW A REAL SUBMARINE IS MADE AND
WORKS</small></div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we told you in the first chapter, there are two
kinds of undersea boats. These are (1) the Holland,
or <i>submarine</i> type, and (2) the Lake, or <i>submersible</i>
type. Now, the Holland boat has a shape very much
like a cat-fish—that is, it has a blunt round head—and
hence it can dive easily; while the Lake is shaped more
like an ordinary boat and has a large <i>superstructure</i>,
as that part above the <i>hull</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is called, and this makes
it easier for the Lake to <i>submerge</i>—that is, sink on
an even keel.</p>

<p>As the art of undersea boat building moved on
apace, the two kinds of craft began to lose their original
distinctive features and were merged into a single
type. This was done to get a boat that was as strong
and as speedy as and could dive like the Holland, and
to have at the same time a boat that was as fast and
as seaworthy on the surface as the Lake.</p>

<p>This is the reason that most of the undersea craft of
to-day are a cross between the two kinds. In the
older boats, though, the difference is still marked; but
the machinery of both is just about the same, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
consequently what we shall tell you of one is just as
true of the other, and from now on we shall call both
kinds simply <i>submarines</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Parts of a Submarine.</b>—To begin with, a
submarine is formed of: (1) the <i>hull</i>; (2) the <i>superstructure</i>,
which is built on the hull; (3) the <i>steering
apparatus</i>, which includes the submerging and diving
devices; (4) the <i>power plant</i>, which consists of the engines,
the dynamo-motors, and the storage batteries,
all of which drive the submarine when it is on the surface
and under the water-line.</p>

<p>As the power plant is a most important part of the
anatomy of a submarine, it will need a whole chapter
to describe it the right way, and this will come next.
Now I’ll start in and tell you about the other parts
of the submarine.</p>

<p><b>How the Hull Is Made.</b>—The hull is made of
thin but very strong sheets of steel riveted together.
As the pressure of the water on it amounts to 187
pounds to the square inch, at a depth of 300 feet, it
must be well braced or else there would be the unpleasant
possibility that it might be crushed in. As
a rule, though, a submarine never travels at a depth
much greater than 100 feet.</p>

<p>Now, there are really two classes of submarines:
(a) those that are built for coast patrol cruising, and
(b) those that are built for trans-oceanic going.</p>

<p>A submarine of the first kind seldom has rough
weather to contend with, and so she need not be
built as strong as one that is designed for ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
going. She also has a slightly different shape from
the latter, in that she has a round cross-section, as
shown in <a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="365" height="332" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_23"></a>FIG. 23. CROSS-SECTION OF COAST-GOING SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p>By looking at <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a> you will see that the ocean-going
submarine is more nearly half-round; this tends
to prevent her from rolling unduly. She also has a
double hull which is divided into watertight compartments
to protect her from sinking should an enemy
ship ram or fire on her. The compartments are used
as stowage tanks for fuel, etc., and so the space between
the inner and outer <i>skins</i>, as the hulls are
called, is not wasted.</p>

<p>A large number of fittings are fixed to the hull, such
as the <i>diving</i> and <i>steering</i> rudders (all of which will
be described later), while the superstructure is built on
top of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><b>What the Superstructure Is.</b>—The <i>superstructure</i>
consists of (1) the deck and (2) the conning
tower. In the Holland submarine the deck is only
about one-third as long as the boat and this allows it
to dive easily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="363" height="318" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_24"></a>FIG. 24. CROSS-SECTION OF OCEAN-GOING SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p>The Lake boat is decked over nearly the whole
length of the hull. In it are fitted rapid-fire guns which
disappear, and there are watertight ventilators which
let in fresh air when the boat is traveling on the surface.
Further there is a <i>hatch</i>—that is, an opening in
the deck with a watertight door—through which the
torpedoes can be lowered into the <i>hold</i> of the submarine.</p>

<p><b>The Outside of the Conning Tower.</b>—From out
of the center of the deck rises the <i>conning tower</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
is a heavily armored, shell-proof, circular structure,
from which the captain makes his observations and
sends his orders down into the engine-room and controlling
compartments. On the bridge or upper deck
of the conning tower is a hatch by which the crew can
get into and out of the boat.</p>

<p>A steering wheel and compass are fixed to the outside
of the conning tower, and the submarine can be
steered by these when it is running on the surface. A
stanchion for carrying the signal lights is also secured
to the conning tower; while the <i>periscope</i>, or eye of
the submarine, passes through the bridge and to one
side of the hatch. Of this wonderful instrument we
shall have much to say a little further on.</p>

<p>Wires, or <i>stays</i>, as they are called, fore and aft are
used to brace and hold the periscope and signal stanchion
firm against the force of the water which presses
on them when the craft is submerged and under way.
The tops of the signal stanchion and the periscope are
also braced by a <i>signal halyard</i>, which is simply a wire,
or cable, stretched taut between them.</p>

<p>On all modern submarines a <i>wireless aerial</i> is attached
to a mast which can be folded down flat on the
deck when the submarine is getting ready to make
a dive.</p>

<p><b>A Look Inside of the Hull.</b>—Now let’s take a
look inside of the submarine. The whole hull is divided
up into a number of watertight compartments,
any one of which can be shut off from the others and
so lessen the danger of sinking by ramming or by shell-fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
should the boat be afloat. In these compartments
are placed all the machinery and the controls for operating
the submarine.</p>

<p>These various compartments are: (1) the conning
tower; (2) the navigating compartment; (3) the engine
and dynamo room; (4) the fore and aft storage
battery rooms; (5) the fuel tanks; (6) the diving control
compartment; (7) the fore and aft ballast tanks;
(8) the water pumps; (9) the fore and aft high pressure
air flasks; (10) the high pressure air compressor;
(11) the torpedo compartment; (12) the mine compartment;
(13) the trimming tanks; (14) the quarters
of the crew; and (15) the quarters of the officers.
All of these are clearly shown in <a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>.</p>

<p>The watertight doors of these compartments are
worked by <i>worm</i> gears, driven by electric motors, as
shown in <a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>, and any of the doors can be opened
or shut by merely throwing a switch.</p>

<p><b>A Peep into the Conning Tower.</b>—The free
space inside of the conning tower is not more than 8
feet in height and 10 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Sticking down through the deck for about 2½ feet
is the periscope, or two of them, for all submarines
now built are fitted with a pair of them so that should
one of them be hit and put out of business the other
will be available.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i_057-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="600" height="335" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_25"></a>FIG. 25. THE MAIN PARTS OF A SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p>This instrument is formed of a long tube with a
hood at the upper end, which is outside of the conning
tower, and an elbow at the lower end, inside of the
tower. An eye-piece is fixed to the lower end, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the captain can scan the horizon at all times. How
a periscope is made and used will be described in a
later chapter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;">

<div class="attrib"><i>Courtesy of Scientific American</i></div>

<div class="caption">THE CONNING TOWER (UPPER) AND NAVIGATING COMPARTMENT
(LOWER) CONTROLS OF A MODERN SUBMARINE</div>
</div>

<p>Just below the eye-piece of the periscope is the underwater
steering wheel, and close to and to one side
of the latter is the underwater compass. In the more
recent submarines a <i>gyroscopic compass</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is used as
well as the regular magnetic compass because the gyroscopic
compass is not affected by stray magnetic lines
of force. Besides, a <i>gyro</i> compass, as it is called for
short, points to the true north instead of to the magnetic
north pole, and a true compass is of the greatest
importance in guiding the submarine at night or when
it is submerged, for it is then as blind as the fish in
Mammoth Cave.</p>

<p>Around the inside of the tower near the bridge are
placed <i>ports</i> through which the captain makes and
takes his observation when the boat is afloat. Within
easy reach of his mouth are <i>speaking tubes</i> which lead
to the engine, diving, and torpedo compartments. The
captain also has at his finger-ends an electric signal
system of lights and bells, which he operates by push
buttons and switches.</p>

<p>So you see he can get into instant touch with all the
vital parts of his boat. He also has full control over
the trimming tanks and the storage batteries, both of
which I shall tell you about in detail presently.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Right in the line of sight of his eyes is a <i>depth meter</i>
by which he can see at a glance at just what depth his
craft is moving, and he can also see at what
<i>angle</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the diving rudder, or <i>elevator</i>, as it is called,
is set.</p>

<p>A compartment <i>tell-tale</i> (a numbered chart showing
each compartment of the boat) also hangs in sight,
and if a compartment should begin to leak it is instantly
indicated by the tell-tale, which in this case is a
miniature electric lamp that lights up back of the
number.</p>

<p>By pressing a button he can ring an electric bell in
the leaking compartment and so warn the crew that
he is about to close the electrically operated <i>bulkhead</i>
door and so shut the compartment off from the rest of
the boat if the damage done is so serious that it cannot
be repaired.</p>

<p><b>Now the Navigating Compartment.</b>—As you
have read before, the conning tower is not a part of
the hull but of the superstructure. Now, when the
captain or any of his crew wants to get from the conning
tower into the hull of the boat he must do so
through a hatch in the lower deck which is exactly
like the hatch in the top or bridge of the tower.</p>

<p>This arrangement makes it easy to shut off the conning
tower into the rest of the boat if it should be
seriously damaged by shell-fire or by collision. Should
this happen, the boat is steered from another compartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
called the <i>navigating room</i>, in which are all of
the devices used in the conning tower. So you see
there are two complete navigating rooms and an outside
deck control by which the submarine can be
steered and operated, no matter how badly damaged
she may be.</p>

<p><b>Next, the Diving Control Compartment.</b>—The
compartment containing the <i>diving control</i>, by means
of which the submarine can be made to dive and to
come to the surface, is fitted with the following devices:</p>

<p>First, there is the <i>diving wheel</i>, which works the
horizontal or diving rudders.</p>

<p>Next, there is the <i>angle indicator</i>, which is simply
a <i>quadrant</i>—that is, a quarter of a circle—marked off
into degrees and each degree into quarters. It has a
needle which moves over the quadrant as the pilot
turns the diving wheel and this indicates the number of
degrees up or down the horizontal rudders have moved.</p>

<p>Another instrument is the <i>depth indicator</i>.</p>

<p>Then there is also an indicator which is merely a
modified form of a carpenter’s <i>spirit</i> level. This little
device shows when the craft is running on an even keel
and when it is running with its keel inclined. For
instance, should the diving rudder fail to respond to
the touch of the man at the wheel, the level would
indicate it, as would also the depth indicator.</p>

<p>Other fittings are the levers and the valve controls,
by means of which water can be let into the ballast
tanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, before I explain how the submarine is made
to dive and how the ballast tanks work, or, rather, the
other way about, I want to tell you a little about the
why and the wherefore of these very interesting operations.</p>

<p><b>The Four States of the Submarine.</b>—A submarine
has four states, or conditions, in which it exists
in the water. These are (1) the <i>light</i>, or surface cruising
condition; (2) the <i>awash</i>, or partly submerged
condition; (3) the <i>submerged</i> condition; and (4) the
<i>totally submerged</i> condition—all of which is clearly
shown in the diagram <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="463" height="273" alt="diagram of four stages of submersion" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_26"></a>FIG. 26. HOW THE SUBMARINE SUBMERGES OR THE FOUR STATES OF
THE SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Light Condition.</i>—The light, or cruising, condition
is simply the position a submarine takes when
she floats on the water, due to her own natural buoyancy,
and it is exactly like that of any other ship.</p>

<p>While in this position the captain takes his observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
from the deck, if there is no danger of being hit
by the enemy; but if there is danger, he then makes
his observations through the ports from the inside of
the conning tower.</p>

<p><i>The Awash Condition.</i>—This condition is not as
natural as the one just described, and it has to be done
by means of the ballast tanks. These are located fore
and aft and they can be connected with, or disconnected
from, each other at will.</p>

<p>Now, when the captain wants to bring his submarine
to the awash condition an <i>inlet valve</i>, or <i>Kingston
valve</i> as it is called, is opened and the sea-water then
flows into these tanks, the amount and velocity of the
inrushing water being, of course, under control at all
times.</p>

<p>This extra weight destroys part of the buoyancy of
the boat, and as she gets heavier she sinks until nothing
but her conning tower remains above the water-line,
the deck being awash. While in this condition
observations are taken either from the ports in the
conning tower or with the periscope, the object-glass
of which has been lowered enough to become useful.</p>

<p><i>The Submerged Condition.</i>—In this condition the
periscope alone remains above the water. It is had by
allowing more water to flow into the ballast tanks,
thus destroying a little more of the craft’s buoyancy,
which makes her sink down until the conning tower
is completely submerged. It is in this condition that
the captain makes his observations with the periscope.</p>

<p><i>The Totally Submerged Condition.</i>—This is an exaggeration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the submerged condition, and it is had
by letting still more water flow into the ballast tanks,
thus sinking the submarine completely. The only way
to steer the boat when it is in this condition is, of
course, by means of the compass, for both the conning
tower and the periscope are totally submerged.</p>

<p>But do not mistake the term <i>totally submerged</i> to
mean that the buoyancy of the submarine is <i>totally destroyed</i>;
for such is not the case during any stage
of its submergence. You can easily see that if the
buoyancy were completely destroyed the submarine
would then become a dead weight and sink to the bottom
of the sea, never more to rise.</p>

<p>Instead, when the submarine is totally submerged
she can, by what is known as her <i>reserve</i>, or <i>extra</i>
buoyancy, and about which you will read later on,
come to the awash or the light condition in a few minutes
by simply pumping the water out of the ballast
tanks.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_27"></a>FIG. 27. FORE DIVING HORIZONTAL RUDDERS OR HYDROPLANES
OF A SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p><b>How a Submarine Dives.</b>—Now let’s get back to
the way a submarine dives. In the first place, let us
suppose the boat is running in the light, or cruising,
condition. An enemy ship is sighted and the captain
of the undersea craft gives orders to clear the deck
and close the hatches. Then he brings the boat from
the cruising to the awash condition, which is done
as we have just described.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<a href="images/i_064b-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_064b.jpg" width="460" height="134" alt="diagram of diving sub" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_28"></a>FIG. 28. HOW THE SUBMARINE DIVES.</div>
</div>

<p>Next, he gives the order to the man at the diving
wheel to make the dive. He does not need to do this
by word of mouth but he can use an electric indicator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which points out the angle at which he wants the horizontal
rudders set (see <a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>). Contrary, now, to
what you might expect, a submarine cannot dive at
any angle, but it must make a very shallow dive.</p>


<p>So when the order is given, the diving rudders are
set at only ½ a degree from the horizontal, as shown
in <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>. The craft must move through the water
at about 5 knots, which is the proper diving speed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
When the conning tower is one-fourth submerged the
angle of the rudders is increased to 1¼ degrees.</p>

<p>This angle is held until the conning tower is half
submerged; and then the angle is changed to 2 degrees,
and it is held there until the conning tower is three-quarters
submerged. As soon as this takes place, the
angle is decreased to 1¼ degrees again, and the rudders
remain at this angle until the dive is completed.</p>

<p><i>Why a Shallow Dive Is Made.</i>—The reason such a
shallow dive must be made is the result of having to
let water into the ballast tanks to bring the craft to the
awash condition before diving.</p>

<p>If the angle of the dive were to be suddenly increased
to 10 or 15 degrees the tilting of the boat
would throw all the water forward in the tanks and
this would seriously upset her balance, and might even
make her settle nose downward to the bottom of the
sea.</p>

<p><i>How the Boat Is Kept Submerged.</i>—When a dive
is to be made the diving rudders are set at the angles
just mentioned, but water is not let into the ballast
tanks at the same time, for this would also tend to destroy
the balance of the boat.</p>

<p>But when the captain wants to keep his submarine
at a certain depth below the surface of the water after
the dive is made he has water admitted to the ballast
tanks and this keeps her at that level. When he wants
to return to the surface, or “break water,” the water
is pumped out and then the diving rudders are set and
the boat makes an upward glide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Time It Takes for a Dive.</i>—The time needed
for a submarine to get ready to dive is about 2 minutes;
but this is often long enough for it to become a
target if a submarine chaser is on the little war-dog’s
trail. Should she be hard pressed she might dive at
a steeper angle—say, 5 degrees, but never more, and
under ordinary conditions she will never dive at more
than 2 degrees’ inclination.</p>

<p>The reason it takes time for a submarine to get
ready to dive is because the wireless masts have to be
folded in, the machine guns disappeared, and the
hatches fastened down. Finally, it must not be forgotten
that a submarine can dive only when she is pushing
ahead under power. If she is at rest and the captain
wants her to sink he must either start her engines
or else be content to simply submerge her on an even
keel.</p>

<p><b>The Ballast Pumps and What They Do.</b>—The
pumps which pump the water from the ballast tanks
are driven by electric motors. They must be powerful
pumps, for they not only have to pump the water out
of the tanks quickly, but they have to force it out
against the pressure of water in which the submarine
is submerged; this pressure increases the deeper the
boat sinks, and it is often 80 pounds or more to the
square inch. The pumps are controlled from the
conning tower, and also from the navigating compartment.</p>

<p><b>What the Buoyancy Tanks Are For.</b>—We said
previously that a submarine never loses its buoyancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
completely. If she were built like an ordinary ship and
simply fitted with ballast tanks, she would sink when
these are filled with water and never come up again,
for her natural buoyancy would be destroyed. As it
is, a submarine has tanks filled with air which keeps
her buoyant, and these will bring her to the surface
the moment the ballast tanks are empty.</p>

<p>Make this experiment and you will quickly understand
how these buoyancy air tanks work: Take an
empty bottle and cork it up tight. It looks empty,
but as a matter of fact it is filled with <i>air</i>. Push the
bottle to the bottom of a bucket of water; let go of it
and the instant you do so it will rise to the surface.</p>

<p>A large number of steel air tanks, or buoyancy tanks,
or high pressure <i>air-flasks</i>, as they are called, are
placed both fore and aft in a submarine, and these are
filled with compressed air at a pressure of 2,000 pounds
to the square inch. These air-flasks have a tremendous
supporting power—which is only another way of saying
that they are extremely buoyant.</p>

<p>It must be clear now that even though the submarine
is resting on the floor of the ocean it can always
rise to the surface by the <i>reserve buoyancy</i> provided
by these air-flasks.</p>

<p><b>Compressed Air and Air-Compressor Pumps.</b>—The
air-flasks are filled with compressed air by <i>air-compressor
pumps</i> which are driven by the engines
when the submarine is running light or awash.</p>

<p>The air compressor is formed of several air pumps
coupled together; each air pump is made very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
like a water pump, but it sucks the air in from the
outside and then forces it into the air-flasks until it is
under a pressure of 2,000 pounds to the square inch.
To overcome this <i>back pressure</i>, as it is called, the
pumps must be extra powerful.</p>

<p>These pumps also supply compressed air for the
torpedo tubes, the trimming tanks, and to help blow
out the water from the ballast tanks.</p>

<p><b>Inside the Torpedo Compartment.</b>—The torpedo
compartment contains the extra torpedoes in their cradles.
Near the tubes from which the torpedoes are
shot is the compressed air which furnishes the propulsive
power needed to make the torpedoes leave their
tubes.</p>

<p><b>Why Trimming Tanks Are Used.</b>—As a torpedo
weighs nearly 1,000 pounds, it is plain that whenever
one is shot from the craft it will very greatly disturb
the balance of the boat unless some means is used to
add weight to it which is exactly equal to the weight
of the torpedo.</p>

<p>This is done by what is called the <i>trimming tanks</i>.
These are usually placed fore and aft and in or near
the torpedo and mine compartments. As soon as a
torpedo is shot, or a mine is laid, the trimming tanks
are filled with water which makes up for the weight
lost and keeps the craft on an even keel.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, any extra weight is taken
aboard the submarine, enough water to equal it is
blown out by compressed air.</p>

<p><b>In the Mine Compartment.</b>—The mine, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
stationary bombs that are to be laid in a harbor or
some other <i>strategic</i> point are called, are kept in the
mine compartment.</p>

<p>This compartment has a trap door in it through
which a <i>mine-layer</i>, that is a man dressed in a diving-suit,
can get out of and back into the submarine again,
or through which the mines can be lowered.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_29"></a>FIG. 29. MUSHROOM ANCHOR.</div>
</div>

<p><b>And Last of All, the Sea Anchor.</b>—A submarine
must have an anchor as well as a merchantman. The
anchor is of the <i>mushroom</i> type, so called from its
appearance; and as you will see from the accompanying
picture (<a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29</a>), it is very different from the two
armed and fluked kind that so resembles an Irishman’s
anchor i.e., a pickax.</p>

<p><b>Where the Crew of a Submarine Lives.</b>—Proper
quarters for the officers and crew in the earlier submarines
were sadly neglected; but conditions have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
greatly changed since then—though of course they are
not quite so good as living in a luxurious hotel ashore.</p>

<p>Great improvements have been made in behalf of
the undersea navigators and sailors, until in the more
recent submarines the crew have quarters that compare
favorably with those on board a battleship.</p>

<p>There are oxygen tanks that supply pure air, while
electric fans set up a forced draft and keep the air
cool and make it circulate freely. Then there are electric
heaters which keep the temperature just right under
all conditions.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the modern submarine
has its <i>galley</i>—that is, its cook room. But, very different
from the galley on the old windjammers that
used to sail the seas, the sea-cook does not use a cook-stove,
which was also called a galley, but electricity.</p>

<div class="faux">CHAPTER IV<br />

THE HEART OF THE SUBMARINE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the time of the first propelled underwater boat
great strides have been made in the methods of driving
the submarine, until at the present day the <i>power plant</i>
seems to be well-nigh perfect.</p>

<p>As the steam engine was improved upon, its value
for driving submarines became better thought of by
inventors, not because it was at all suitable for the purpose,
but in virtue of the fact that it was the first and
for a long time the only practical scheme to produce
power on a large scale. For this reason, all the early
and even some of the later submarines were powered
with steam engines.</p>

<p><b>What a Good Power Plant Is.</b>—There are certain
things an engine must be and do to make it useful
for driving a submarine boat, and among the chief
ones are:</p>

<p>(1) It must be as small and as light as possible and
still have great strength.</p>

<p>(2) It must develop a lot of power for its size and
weight.</p>

<p>(3) It must use a small amount of fuel for the
power it develops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) The fuel it uses must not be bulky for the
power it gives.</p>

<p>(5) It must not give off odors.</p>

<p>(6) All working parts must be easily getatable, and</p>

<p>(7) It must not give off poisonous gases, or vapors
that ignite easily, for either of these are dangerous.</p>

<p>From this you will see that it is not an easy matter
to make an engine for a submarine that will have all
of these good features, but inventors have come pretty
close to it, as you will presently learn.</p>

<p><b>The Faults of the Steam Engine.</b>—Now while
the steam engine was the only motive power that could
be used in the early submarine for driving it when
both afloat and under water, it lacked nearly every one
of the good features named above; for,</p>

<p>(1) While a steam engine can be made light and
strong, a large heavy boiler is needed, and this makes
the boat a very hot and unhealthful place for the crew;
(2) it is very wasteful of fuel, for most of the heat
energy<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that is stored up in the coal or oil is lost before
it ever reaches the engine; (3) if coal is used, it
is too bulky, and if oil is used it is too liable to give off
vapors which will catch on fire and explode.</p>

<p>These untoward features did not matter so much
when the submarine was afloat, but when she was
cruising below the water they were all present to make
life miserable for the crew. But when the <i>storage battery</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
was put into such shape that it could be used, all
this was changed and the conditions were so improved
that undersea travel became bearable and pretty safe
as well. We will tell you all about the storage battery
and how it develops power a little further on.</p>

<p><b>When the Gasoline Engine Came.</b>—The next improvement
in submarine power plants came when the
gasoline engine was made practical.</p>

<p>This new kind of a <i>prime mover</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was so much better
in every way than the steam engine that nearly all
submarines now built are powered with them in one
form or another.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/i_076a.jpg" width="463" height="242" alt="drawing of an engine" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_30"></a>FIG. 30. EIGHT CYLINDER GASOLINE OR PETROL ENGINE.</div>
</div>

<p>The usual kind of gasoline engine is known as the
<i>four cycle type</i> and has from 12 to 16 <i>cylinders</i>, the
<i>pistons</i> of each of which are connected to one <i>crankshaft</i>,
and together they form a <i>power unit</i>, as the
complete engine is sometimes called.</p>

<p>A submarine engine of this kind can develop upwards
of 5,000 horsepower and the large units weigh
close to 100 tons. Except that it is larger and is built
especially to meet the needs of the submarine it is exactly
like a motor car or an airplane engine which is
shown in <a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>.</p>

<p><b>How the Gasoline Engine Works.</b>—A single
cylinder gasoline engine is easier to understand than
one with four or more cylinders, so I’ll describe it
first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<a href="images/i_076b-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_076b.jpg" width="395" height="217" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_31"></a>FIG. 31. HOW A FOUR-CYCLE GASOLINE ENGINE WORKS.</div>
</div>

<p>It consists of (1) a <i>cylinder</i> with <i>valves</i> in it and
in which a piston moves to and fro; this is connected
to (2) a crankshaft by means of (3) a piston rod as
shown in <a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>. To the cylinder is fixed (4) a <i>carburetor</i>
which mixes the gasoline with the air and
forms the explosive gas, or <i>fuel mixture</i> as it is called,
and (5) a <i>high tension magneto</i> which generates an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
electric current to make the spark that fires the fuel
mixture, etc.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand how a gas-engine works if
you will just remember that for every <i>power stroke</i>
there are three other strokes, making four strokes altogether,
or <i>four cycles</i> as it is called.</p>

<p>The power stroke of the piston is the stroke made by
the explosion of the fuel mixture and this forces the
piston down. This is the stroke that turns the crankshaft
<i>one-half</i> of a revolution and gives it force enough
to carry it around until the next power stroke takes
place. Thus the flywheel of a single cylinder four-cycle
engine makes two complete turns or revolutions
to each power stroke of the piston.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a> shows how the inlet and exhaust valves are
worked, each one by a little wheel with a lump on one
side, or <i>cam</i>, as it is called, which is fixed on a <i>cam-shaft</i>
and is turned by the crankshaft. The cams, of
which there are two for each cylinder, are set directly
under the ends of the <i>valve rods</i>, and as the cam-shaft
revolves, the little lumps on the cam strike the valve
rods at the right moments and this lets the fuel
mixture into the cylinder and lets the used and burnt-up
gases out of it.</p>

<p>Each valve is provided with a stiff spring, which, as
soon as the lump on the cam has turned past the valve
rod, lets the latter drop again and so closes the valve.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a> also shows the complete action of a four-cycle
engine. The <i>suction stroke</i> is shown at <i>A</i>; as the
piston moves down, the cam forces the inlet valve up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and the piston sucks the fuel mixture into the cylinder.
The exhaust valve is closed while this stroke is taking
place.</p>

<p>The <i>compression stroke</i> is shown at <i>B</i>; the <i>momentum</i>,
that is the stored up energy of the flywheel, carries
the piston up and forces the fuel mixture into a
very small space, that is, it <i>compresses</i> it. By this time
the cams have moved past the valve rods and both the
inlet and exhaust valves are closed.</p>

<p>The <i>power stroke</i> is shown at <i>C</i>, and this is the only
one of the four strokes that actually counts. When
the fuel mixture is compressed it is exploded by an
electric spark and the force of the explosion drives the
piston down and gives the flywheel great momentum.</p>

<p>It is the momentum produced by this stroke that not
only furnishes enough power to carry the flywheel
round until another power stroke takes place, but also
furnishes the excess power to do useful work, such as
to drive a dynamo or a propeller. Of course both
valves are closed when this stroke is being made.</p>

<p>The <i>exhaust stroke</i> is shown at <i>D</i> and is one of the
up strokes of the piston. The cam opens the exhaust
valve and the piston forces the burnt gases of the
fuel mixture out of the <i>exhaust port</i>, and that clears
the cylinder for the next stroke, which will be the <i>A</i>
stroke over again, and so on through the same four
cycles just described.</p>

<p><i>The Carburetor and What It Does.</i>—This apparatus
is connected to the <i>fuel tanks</i>, which usually contains
gasoline, by a supply pipe. The gasoline is forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
out of the tank by compressed air being pumped into
the latter and thence it passes into the carburetor.</p>

<p>The carburetor changes the liquid fuel into a fine
spray, or vapor, and mixes it with air, and this is
drawn into the cylinder when the inlet valve opens and
the piston is making its suction stroke.</p>

<p><i>The Magneto Electric Machine.</i>—This is an electrical
device which is simply a little dynamo. When it
is driven by the engine it generates a <i>high tension current</i>
of electricity which will jump between the ends of
two wires ⅛ inch apart, and this makes a spark.</p>

<p>The magneto is connected to a <i>spark-plug</i> which is
screwed into the head of the cylinder. A <i>timer</i> connected
to the magneto and the spark-plug closes the
circuit each time the compression stroke is completed;
the instant the circuit is closed the current generated
by the magneto makes a spark at the business end of
the spark-plug and this fires the fuel mixture.</p>

<p>But as good as the gasoline engine is for motor cars,
power boats, and airplanes, it has been found sadly
wanting as a power plant for submarines; this is due
not to any fault of the engine but to the explosive
nature of the gasoline which is used.</p>

<p>Gasoline is a very <i>volatile</i> liquid, that is, at ordinary
temperatures and pressures it tends to change from its
liquid state to a vapor which is really a gaseous state.
You may have noticed this if you have been near a
place where gasoline is stored, for the whole air is
<i>saturated</i> with the vapor given off by it and this is
what you smell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, it is quite impossible to store a fuel like
gasoline, and to use it for firing an engine in such a
confined space as there is on a submarine, without the
air becoming charged with the vapor, which is injurious
to those who breathe it, and which, should it be
accidentally ignited, would explode with such force
that it would wreck and sink the submarine.</p>

<p><b>The Last Word in Submarine Engines.</b>—Having
tried out both steam and gasoline engines for submarine
work and both having been found wanting,
further experiments were made in engine building.</p>

<p>Now, since it was known that the chief fault of the
gasoline engine lay in the fuel it used and not in the
engine itself, inventors worked hard to make an engine
that would burn a fuel so much heavier and less
volatile than gasoline that all danger from vapor
would be done away with.</p>

<p>Many engines were built along this line, but all failed
until Diesel (pronounced Dé-sel), a German inventor,
found a way to make an engine that would burn
a heavy oil. The Diesel engine is now used in every
submarine that is built, nearly; and for this reason I
want you to understand exactly how it is made and
how it works.</p>

<p><i>How the Diesel Engine Works.</i>—The Diesel engine
works on the same general principle as the gasoline engine—that
is, by the explosion of a fuel mixture in the
cylinders—but it is different from the gasoline engine
in the way in which the fuel is admitted into the cylinder
and fired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Diesel engine, a rough diagram of which is
shown in <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>, there are two valves in the head of
the cylinder, one of which lets in the heavy fuel mixture
and the other one admits compressed air to the
cylinder. The exhaust valve is at the bottom of the
cylinder, and the lower part of the cylinder is built to
form an air compressor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 314px;">
<a href="images/i_081-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="314" height="228" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_32"></a>FIG. 32. A TWO-CYCLE DIESEL ENGINE.</div>
</div>

<p>The way it works is like this:</p>

<p>(a) When the compressed air valve opens, the compressed
air is forced into the cylinder and this drives
the piston down when the valve closes.</p>

<p>(b) The power that this stroke gives to the flywheel
forces the piston up again, and this compresses
the air as shown in <i>A</i>, <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>. Now when you compress
air, it heats it, and the amount of heat developed
depends on how much the air is compressed; you can
even feel the heat that is set up by compressing the air
in a toy pop-gun; or you may have noticed that when
an automobile tire is pumped up fast it gets hot. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
course, while the air is being compressed in the cylinder
of the engine the compressed air valve stays closed.</p>

</div>

<p>(c) When the fuel inlet valve opens, the heavy fuel
is forced into the cylinder by means of compressed air
which presses on the fuel in the supply tank. The instant
the fuel strikes the hot air in the cylinder it
ignites and burns, and as it burns it expands just as
the gases of burning powder in a cartridge expand.
This forces the piston down and makes the power
stroke as shown in <i>B</i>, <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

<p>Here, then, is another great advantage of the Diesel
engine over the ordinary gasoline engine: it does not
need an electric spark or any other kind of flame to
fire it.</p>

<p>(d) As soon as the piston has reached the down
end of its power stroke, the exhaust ports are opened
and more compressed air flows through the compressed
air valve; this blows what is left of the burnt gases
out of the cylinder through the ports, and as soon as
this is done the piston starts to go up, when it compresses
whatever air there is in the cylinder again.</p>

<p>While this stroke is being made the air compressor
piston in the bottom of the cylinder, which is a part of
the regular piston, has been compressing the air needed
to perform the above operations. Since there is only
one waste stroke to every power stroke, the engine is
a <i>two-cycle</i> one, and herein lies its third big advantage
over the gasoline engine.</p>


<p>The reason that the Diesel engine is better adapted
to burn heavier oils than the gasoline engine is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the latter uses an electric spark to ignite the fuel mixture
and this must be very light and volatile, since the
spark is not hot enough to fire the heavier oils.</p>

<p>Again, in a gasoline engine the fuel mixture <i>explodes</i>—that
is, it burns very rapidly, like the powder charge
in a cartridge—whereas in a Diesel engine the fuel
mixture <i>expands</i> when it is ignited, very much as steam
expands in the cylinder of a steam engine.</p>

<p>Using heavy oils very greatly reduces the cost of operating
an engine, for oils of this kind are usually
the <i>by-products</i> obtained in the making of petroleum
and gasoline. These heavy oils are of little value for
any other purpose than fuel; and, also, since the oil is
heavy, it is more easily handled than gasoline.</p>

<p>For these very good reasons the Diesel engine (<a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>),
is used by nearly every government at the present
time for submarine power plants. Moreover, like the
steam engine, it will develop its greatest power, nearly,
on starting; it does not need any <i>reducing gears</i> to
lower its speed—this is done with a <i>throttle</i> as it is in a
steam engine; and it can be reversed without a reversing
gear, which is better than the steam engine.</p>

<p>The Diesel engines of present-day make range from
900 to 5,000 horsepower, and eight or more cylinders
are used for each engine. The weight of the engine is
about 30 pounds per horsepower; or for a 5,000
horsepower engine the weight is in the neighborhood
of 70 tons. As great as this weight may seem, it is
much lighter for the horsepower produced than the
old-fashioned gasoline engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><b>Why An Electric Power Plant Is Needed.</b>—As
you know, a submarine has two chief conditions, and
these are (1) when it is <i>afloat</i>, and (2) when it is <i>submerged</i>.</p>

<p>When she is afloat the air in the craft and which
the crew must breathe is being constantly sucked in
from the outside, and there is always a large enough
supply to keep the compartments clear and to furnish
the air compressors which fill the tanks. But when
the boat is submerged there is no way of getting a fresh
supply unless air is taken from the tanks or the submarine
goes to the surface every little while, like a
whale, and this would hardly do.</p>

<p><b>The Dynamo-Motor and Storage Battery System.</b>—When
the storage battery came into use inventors of
submarines were quick to see that the thing to do was
to use two separate and distinct power plants and
these are (1) the steam or gas engine, which is used
when the boat is running afloat; and (2) the electric
storage battery system, which is used when the craft
is running submerged.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="310" height="245" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_34"></a>FIG. 34. A SUBMARINE DYNAMO MOTOR.</div>
</div>

<p>Three devices must be used for the undersea electric
power plant, namely, (1) the <i>dynamo</i>, which generates
the electric current; (2) the <i>storage battery</i>, which is
charged by the current generated by the dynamo, and
(3) the <i>motor</i>, which develops power when a current
from the storage battery is made to flow through it.
The diagram shown in <a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a> will make the electric
connections clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><i>About the Dynamo.</i>—The <i>dynamo</i><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> (see <a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>)
is connected to the crankshaft of the engine and is
driven by it. It changes the mechanical motion of the
engine into an electric current. This electrical energy
must then be stored up so that it can be used later
when the craft is submerged and it is wanted.</p>

<p><i>And Now the Storage Battery.</i>—To store up the
electrical energy a <i>storage battery</i> (see <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a>) is
used. When the current is made to flow into this
kind of a battery it charges the battery, and if then
the battery is connected to a motor it will deliver an
electric current, and this runs the motor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 314px;">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="314" height="219" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_35"></a>FIG. 35. A SIMPLE STORAGE BATTERY.</div>
</div>

<p>The storage battery has been almost as big a bugbear
to the submarine builders as the oil engine. It must be
as small and as light as possible; it must not absorb
the oxygen of the air which the crew breathes, and it
must not give off any poisonous gases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, there are two kinds of storage batteries, and
these are (1) the <i>lead-plate</i> storage battery, which is
the oldest form, and (2) the <i>nickel-steel</i> storage battery,
which was invented quite recently by our own
Edison. Both kinds are used in submarines.</p>

<p><i>Last of All, the Motor.</i>—The motor is the last device
by means of which the electric energy is made to
drive the craft when it is undersea.</p>

<p>Now, a dynamo and a motor are made exactly alike,
in fact, a dynamo is a motor and a motor is a dynamo.
That is to say, if you turn the <i>armature</i> of a dynamo,
it will generate a current of electricity, and if you
make a current flow through the coils of a dynamo,
the armature will spin round and it is then a motor.</p>

<p>This being true, however strange it may seem, only
one electric machine is needed to do the work of the
dynamo and the motor; for when it is connected to the
shaft of the engine it will generate a current for
charging the storage battery, and this is done while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the craft is afloat; or it will develop power to drive
the propellers when it is connected to the storage battery,
and this is done when the submarine is cruising
undersea.</p>

MAKING AND SHOOTING THE TORPEDO</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> submarine is first, last, and all the time an engine
of death and destruction. Even in the earliest
underwater experiments, you will remember, it was
fitted with a bomb the sole purpose of which was to
blow the enemy ship to atoms.</p>

<p>The old bomb idea proved next to worthless, for it
was a very hard job to fix it to the ship to be sunk,
and even if the submarine operator did succeed in so
doing it was at best a dangerous piece of business, and
so the odds for its failure were about as 100 is to
1.</p>

<p>As soon, therefore, as the submarine had been developed
to a point where it was clear that it was the
coming weapon of modern naval warfare, inventors
began to rack their brains for some scheme which
would do away with the danger and uncertainty of the
old-fashioned bomb, and to make the submarine safer
for its crew and deadlier for the enemy.</p>

<p>Many attempts were made, but its improvement was
very slow, for the old idea of the simple bomb was
firmly fixed in the minds of the inventors and it was
hard for them to break away from it.</p>

<p>After a long time, though—that is to say in 1860—Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Lupius, an Austrian inventor, hit upon a new
and novel plan for a torpedo which would travel under
water, by means of a little motor in it and a pair
of wires which connected it with the submarine so
that it could be directed at will.</p>

<p><b>The First Submarine Torpedoes.</b>—Lupius took
his idea to Whitehead, an English engineer of genius
and ability, and he built the first controlled torpedo
which traveled under its own power in 1864. Then
Whitehead did a little thinking on his own account and
he built the <i>automobile torpedo</i> in 1868, the cleverest
and most diabolical destroyer that man has ever yet
been guilty of.</p>

<p>The automobile torpedo is one that not only runs
under its own power but that steers itself as well
after it has left the torpedo tube of the submarine.
To Whitehead, then, must be given the credit not only
of having invented the submarine torpedo that is used
with such telling effect in the present war, but of making
a success of it. The Germans, though, with their
great dislike for everything of British name and make
call their torpedo of this type <i>blackheads</i>.</p>

<p><b>How to Make a Model Submarine Torpedo.</b>—Before
I explain how a real automobile torpedo is
made and works, I will tell you how to make a model
torpedo which, while it will not explode at the end of
its trip through the water, will show you how a real
torpedo does its work.</p>

<p><b>The Body of the Torpedo.</b>—Get a piece of nice
soft pine 1½ inches in diameter and 10 inches long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and whittle it out to the shape shown in <a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>. Cut
a groove down the middle of it ¾ inch deep and ¾
inch wide, to within an inch of each end. This done,
screw a small screw-eye in the <i>warhead</i> of the torpedo,
as the blunt nosed end of it is called, inside the
groove.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" width="600" height="258" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_36"></a>FIG. 36. A MODEL TORPEDO.</div>
</div>

<p>Bore a ⅛-inch hole through the propeller end, and
slip a piece of brass tube 2 inches long which has
a bore of inch in it to form a bearing for the
propeller shaft. Get a brass rod <small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></small> inch in diameter
and 2¼ inches long; make an eye on one end and then
push the rod through the brass tube in the tail or propeller
end of the torpedo, as shown in <a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>, and
this is all there is to the propeller shaft. Now cut
a propeller out of tin, as shown at <i>E</i>, in <a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>, and
solder it to the end of the propeller shaft.</p>

<p><i>The Steering and Diving Rudders.</i>—The torpedo,
like the submarine itself, has two rudders, one for
diving and one for steering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 548px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_37"></a>FIG. 37. A, B, C, THE STEERING AND DIVING RUDDERS. D, E, THE
COVER AND PROPELLER.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>To make the <i>steering rudder</i>, which is the vertical
one, cut out a piece of heavy tin 1½ inches wide and
1¾ inches long, as shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>; cut out one
edge ⅜ inch deep as shown by the shaded part, which
will leave a tongue sticking out from each corner, and
bend these to form little tubes.</p>

<p>Cut off two pieces of wire ⅛ inch thick, have each
one 2½ inches long, and bend them as shown at <i>C</i>.
Next drill two holes through the tail or propeller end
of the torpedo, force the sharp ends of the wires into
them and then put the other ends into the tubes of the
rudder.</p>

<p>The <i>diving rudder</i>, which is the horizontal one, is
made like the steering rudder except that the tongues
for the hinge tubes are dropped down a little and a
slot ½ inch wide and 1¾ inches long is cut out, as
shown by the shaded part at <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>This rudder is 1½ inches wide and 2⅛ inches long;
it is fastened by a pair of ⅛ inch wires to the tail end
of the torpedo in the same way as the steering rudder.
This arrangement leaves enough room for the propeller
to turn inside of the wires, as shown at <i>C</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Rubber Strand Motor.</i>—The next thing to do is
to fix one end of the rubber strands to the screw-eye in
the warhead and the other end to the eye of the propeller-shaft.
This gives you a cheap and simple motor
that is at once light, powerful, and easy to manage.</p>

<p>Cut out a cover of wood to fit over the groove containing
the motor, as shown in <i>D</i>, <a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>, and screw
it to the body of the torpedo. Melt some paraffin wax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and run it around the cracks to make the motor chamber
watertight.</p>

<p>Bore half a dozen or more holes ½ inch in diameter
and about an inch deep along the exact middle of the
bottom of the torpedo; fill each hole with shot and
seal them in with sealing-wax. There must be enough
shot in the bottom to weight the little torpedo so that
it will just sink on an even keel when you put it in
the water. Finally, paint the torpedo all over with
black enamel (you can buy it in drug stores for 10
cents a can), and your model torpedo is ready for its
deadly work.</p>

<p><b>Your Torpedo in Action.</b>—To set your model
torpedo scooting under the water and, perchance,
aimed at an enemy ship, fix the steering rudder in a
line with the long axis of the hull and tilt the diving
rudder at a very slight angle, say about 2 degrees,
down from the top of the torpedo.</p>

<p>Hold the hull with your left hand and wind up the
rubber strand motor good and tight by turning the
propeller <i>clockwise</i>—that is, in the direction the hands
of a clock move—with your right hand. When you
have done this, push the torpedo down under the water,
let go of the propeller and she will shoot forward as
though shot by compressed air from a torpedo tube.</p>

<p>After it has made a run of from 25 to 100 feet—the
distance depends on the skill you have shown in building
it—it will sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>Of course if you are playing a naval war game and
you are shooting at some enemy ship, it will give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a good hard bump, and this counts ten points in your
favor.</p>

<p><b>How a Real Torpedo Is Made.</b>—A torpedo, as
you can plainly see, is nothing more nor less than a
miniature submarine boat that moves under its own
power and that is self-controlled. And now that you
have built and experimented with a little model it will
be easy for you to understand how a real one is made
and works.</p>

<p><i>The Warhead of a Torpedo.</i>—A real torpedo such
as is shot by a submarine to sink real ships is made of
three chief parts, as far as the outside of it is concerned.
These are: (1) the <i>warhead</i>, (2) the <i>body</i>,
and (3) the <i>tail</i>.</p>

<p>The warhead is the blunt-nosed hollow part that
forms the business end of the torpedo; it contains two
things: (a) the charge of <i>high powered explosive</i>
which plays such terrific havoc when it is touched off;
and (b) the <i>detonating mechanism</i> which fires it.</p>

<p><i>The High Powered Explosive.</i>—The explosive used
is either <i>guncotton</i>, or <i>nitrocellulose</i>, to call it by its
chemical name, or <i>tri-nitrotoluene</i> (pronounced <i>ni-tro-tol´-u-en</i>)
and which is called <i>TNT</i> for short.</p>

<p>Guncotton is simply ordinary cotton which has been
treated with nitric and sulphuric acids; when this is
done it becomes highly explosive.</p>

<p><i>TNT</i> is <i>toluene</i>, a chemical formed of hydrogen
and carbon, which has been treated with nitric acid. It
is used by the Germans in the warheads of their submarine
torpedoes because it is a more powerful explosive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
than guncotton. Besides it can be melted as easily
as lard and poured into the warhead, which makes it
an easy, quick, and safe job to fill them. Further, it
does not explode easily by shocks when it is transported
but it instantly explodes with a <i>detonator</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_098fp.jpg" width="600" height="383" alt="photograph" />
<div class="attrib"><i>Courtesy of E. W. Bliss Co.</i></div>

<div class="caption">A BLISS TORPEDO WITH ROTARY COMPRESSED AIR MOTOR</div>
</div>
<p>The reason these explosives cannot be ignited by fire
but explode when struck a sharp tap is because they are
very <i>unstable compounds</i>; that is, they are very easily
decomposed into their original chemical parts.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, but by the very discovery of this
advanced scientific principle men are now able to make
the mightiest, which means the deadliest, explosives
that the world has ever known and this makes war a
thousand times as terrible now as it was in the olden
days when men fought their battles at close range
with their ancient lances and cross-bows.</p>

<p><b>The Detonating, or Firing Mechanism.</b>—A modern
submarine torpedo has a diameter of from 18 to 21
inches through the warhead, and this is loaded with
from 200 to 330 pounds of guncotton or TNT, as the
case may be.</p>

<p>This <i>charge</i> is exploded by a <i>firing pin</i>, or <i>pistol</i>, as
it is called. This firing pin goes clear through the
charge and into a <i>percussion cap</i>, which sets just back
of the charge; the other and front end of the firing
pin goes clear through the warhead and has a threaded
end on which is screwed what is known as a <i>butterfly-nut</i>.</p>



<p>The percussion cap is simply a little copper cup and
in it is placed a small charge of an explosive which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is easily detonated by the <i>percussion</i> of the pin, that
is by the pin striking it. The explosive mostly
used in percussion caps is <i>mercuric fulminate</i>, which
is a compound formed of mercury, carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen.</p>

<p>Since it is the violent explosion of the percussion
charge which strikes the main charge of the high explosive
in the warhead, and the fire made by the explosion
of the percussion charge has nothing to do
with it, the main charge of guncotton, where this explosive
is used, is often wet down with water before it
is packed in, for by so doing a great deal more of it
can be put in the same-sized space.</p>

<p>A <i>safety pin</i> (see <a href="#FIG_38">Fig. 38</a>) is set into the firing pin,
so that by no possible chance can the latter pin work
loose and explode the charge until it strikes the ship
it is intended to destroy. Also the butterfly-nut, which
I spoke of above, is used as a further safety factor.</p>

<p>The safety pin is simply a pin which is threaded on
one end and which extends down through the steel casing
of the warhead and screws into the firing pin, or
pistol, and holds it securely so that it cannot strike
back against the charge until it is unscrewed and taken
out or broken off, when it strikes the ship.</p>

<p>The butterfly-nut is simply a thumb nut with a couple
of wings on it. When the torpedo is shot out of
the torpedo tube the butterfly-nut, which is screwed up
close to the warhead on the firing pin, begins to unscrew
itself by the action of the water on the wings,
which now form little propeller blades; by the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the nut reaches the end of the firing pin and drops off,
the torpedo is quite a distance from the submarine
which shot it. In this way, all danger of the torpedo’s
exploding when it is in, or leaving, the submarine, is
done away with. <a href="#FIG_38">Fig. 38</a> shows a cross-section of the
warhead and just how the detonating mechanism is
made and works.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_38"></a>FIG. 38. THE BUSINESS END OR WAR HEAD OF A REAL TORPEDO</div>
</div>

<p>The warheads of the latest torpedoes, especially those
used by the Germans, are fitted with steel cutters, so
that they can cut their way through nets which ships
may spread out to protect themselves.</p>

<p><i>The Body of the Torpedo.</i>—The next part of the
torpedo is the body, and there are five separate and distinct
parts to it. These we have named in the order
of their position, and they are,</p>

<p>(1) The <i>air pressure chamber</i>; (2) the <i>balance
chamber</i>; (3) the <i>power chamber</i>; (4) the <i>buoyancy
chamber</i>, and (5) the <i>tail-piece</i> which supports the
propellers and the rudders.</p>

<p><i>The Compressed Air Tanks.</i>—The air pressure
chamber is simply a large steel tank and air is pumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
into it until it is under a pressure of about 2,000
pounds to the square inch; this means that for every
square inch of the surface of the tank there is a force
pressing against it of about one ton.</p>

<p>The air is let out of the tank through what is known
as a <i>reducing valve</i>, which is in turn connected to the
engines, and more about it will be said a little later. A
reducing valve is simply a valve that regulates the
amount of air which flows from the tank into the engine
and keeps it at the same pressure all the time.</p>

<p>If the valve were not used, the air in the tank,
which is at first under 2,000 pounds pressure, would
drive the torpedo forward at a tremendous rate of
speed at first, but as the air from the tank was used
up by the engine it would lose pressure and the torpedo
would soon stop altogether. But when a reducing
valve is used the torpedo keeps up its same high speed
until it has run its course and has either hit the ship or
missed it.</p>

<p><i>What Is in the Balance Chamber.</i>—In the balance
chamber is the mechanism that controls the steering
and the diving rudders, and it is these that keep the
torpedo on a straight course and at the right depth
under the water.</p>

<p>The controlling mechanism is formed of four chief
devices, which are (1) a <i>gyroscope</i> (pronounced <i>ji´-ro-skop</i>);
(2) a <i>compressed air motor</i>, which drives
the gyroscope; (3) a <i>water pressure control</i>; and (4)
a <i>pendulum control</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Automatic Gyro Control.</i>—The gyroscope, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
just <i>gyro</i>, as it is called for short, is a kind of spinning
top and you can buy a toy one for a quarter.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It is
simply a heavy wheel fixed to a shaft, or spindle, and
this is pivoted in a ring, as shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#FIG_39">Fig. 39</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_39"></a>FIG. 39. THE GYROSCOPE.</div>
</div>

<p>Now hold the gyro as shown at <i>B</i> and give the wheel
a good spin. This done, walk straight ahead, and as
long as you do so you will hardly know that you are
carrying the gyro, but the moment you try to change
your direction you will feel the gyro twisting in your
hand to counteract the movement.</p>

<p>This is the purpose of the gyro in a torpedo, but in
this case the wheel is very heavy and it is revolved at
a high speed by a compressed air motor. The gyro is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
set with its shaft at <i>right angles</i> with the long axis of
the torpedo, as shown at <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>Now, just as long as the torpedo moves straight
ahead in its course, the gyro has no effect on it, but the
moment the torpedo tries to swerve from one side to
the other, or shift out of its course, the gyro pulls it
back by acting on the steering rudder; it does this by
regulating the air supply of a compressed air motor,
called the <i>servo-motor</i>, and this in turn works the rudder
by means of a series of levers. In this way the
torpedo is automatically kept to its course.</p>

<p><i>The Hydrostatic, or Water Pressure, Control.</i>—The
water pressure control is one of the devices which
keeps the torpedo at the right depth in the water.</p>

<p>It consists of a steel cylinder with a piston working
in it. A cylinder which is open at both ends is set in
the hull of the torpedo so that one end opens into
the water outside. A spring presses against the piston
on the inside of the hull and the water presses on the
piston on the outside.</p>

<p>The spring can be adjusted by a screw to just balance
the pressure of the water at any depth. A small
valve rod is fixed to the piston, and this opens a valve
which lets compressed air into a motor when the pressure
of the water is greater or lesser than the pressure
of the spring and this in turn works the diving rudder
as shown in <a href="#FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that the captain wants the
torpedo to travel at a depth of exactly 15 feet during
its whole course. The spring is adjusted to offset the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pressure of the water at this depth, and the torpedo is
launched. Should it for any reason try to go deeper
than 15 feet or to rise above 15 feet, the spring or the
water presses on the piston and closes or opens the air
valve of the motor, when it moves the diving rudder
up or down until the torpedo is brought back to its
right depth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="600" height="406" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_40"></a>FIG. 40. HOW THE WATER PRESSURE CONTROL ACTS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Automatic Pendulum Control.</i>—The water
pressure control, however, is not enough to make the
torpedo stick to an absolutely constant depth, and so
to help it a <i>pendulum control</i> is also used.</p>

<p>This control consists of a pendulum which swings
to and fro from fore to aft as the torpedo dives and
rises, and it also starts the compressed air motor which
operates the diving rudder, and this brings the torpedo
back to its proper depth. It is shown in <a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Engine That Drives the Torpedo.</b>—Next
comes the engine that drives the torpedo, and it, too,
is run by compressed air.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, the air which runs it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
regulated by a reducing valve, but there is another important
part of the power plant, and this is the <i>heater</i>
for heating the compressed air before it is admitted to
the engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" width="312" height="265" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_41"></a>FIG. 41. THE PENDULUM CONTROL.</div>
</div>

<p>Compressed air is as good to run an engine with
as steam, for both of them have tremendous powers
of expansion. As soon as the air is released from the
supply tank—which keeps it compressed in a space that
is many times smaller than it would take up when it is
free—and has passed into the cylinders of the engine,
it begins to <i>expand</i>, or to spread out in every direction,
exactly as steam does.</p>

<p>Now when air is pumped into the tank it gets very
hot and this heat is stored up in the air as <i>energy</i>;
this makes the air when it is released expand with
much force and gives it the power to do useful work.</p>

<p>But as the air is let out of the tank through the reducing
valve it expands and loses its energy—or <i>latent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
heat</i>, as it is called—and this makes it lose its power
to keep on expanding to its greatest extent and so it
gets weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>To overcome this bad feature of compressed air, a
heater is fixed on the engine, and just as the compressed
air reaches the cylinders of the engine it is
suddenly heated and this gives it all the expansive
force it needs. The heater consists of a small oil-burner
which is so fixed that the instant the torpedo
is shot from the tube an electric spark ignites the oil,
and there is, in consequence, neither the loss of time
nor power.</p>

<p>The engine is often of the cylinder and piston type
and is built quite like an automobile engine, except that
the <i>inlet valve</i>—which lets the air into the cylinders—is
disk-shaped so that it can operate all the cylinders
one after another. The exhaust ports open outside of
the torpedo, and it sets up a tell-tale white streak of
bubbles on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Some torpedoes as, for instance, the Bliss-Leavitt,
use a rotary engine. But whichever kind is used,
the power plant develops from 30 to 50 horsepower,
and thus each torpedo weighs about as much and is as
costly as a high-priced motor car.</p>

<p><i>The Propeller-Shaft and Propellers.</i>—<i>The Propeller-Shaft.</i>—The
engine drives the <i>propeller-shaft</i>, or,
as it is called in England, the <i>cardan-shaft</i>. To the
end of this shaft outside of the torpedo is fixed one of
the propellers.</p>

<p>Another hollow shaft is slipped over the first shaft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and one end is connected to the engine and to the other
and outside end of the shaft another propeller is
<i>keyed</i> on. This shaft is driven in the opposite direction
to the solid shaft inside of it by <i>gears</i> that is,
a set of cog-wheels.</p>

<p><i>The Propellers.</i>—The propellers have four blades;
and the reason two propellers are used is to counteract
the force of each other. That is to say, if only one
propeller is used, the force of the blades striking the
water tends to tilt the craft to one side, and hence by
using two propellers this effect is very largely offset.</p>

<p><i>The Steering and Diving Rudders.</i>—The vertical
or steering rudder and the diving or horizontal rudders
are hinged to a frame around the propellers as
shown in <a href="#FIG_42">Fig. 42</a>.</p>

<p>As it takes a lot of power to move these rudders
against the varying water currents, an air engine must
be used to work them instead of levers that are connected
directly with the gyro, pendulum, or water pressure
controls.</p>

<p><b>How a Torpedo Is Shot at a Ship.</b>—And now
comes the most exciting moment of all, and that is
when a torpedo is shot from a submarine at an enemy
ship.</p>

<p>The latest type of submarine usually has eight torpedo
tubes, four of them fore, and four aft. These
tubes are shaped as shown in <a href="#FIG_43">Fig. 43</a>, and are built
right into the hull of the craft.</p>

<p>Now, when we say that a torpedo is <i>shot</i> from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
submarine we do not mean that it is <i>fired</i> from it, for
it does not explode until it hits the ship it is aimed at,
but we simply mean that it is <i>forced</i> out of, or <i>driven</i>
from, the tube of the boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 543px;">
<a href="images/i_108a-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_108a.jpg" width="543" height="116" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_42"></a>FIG. 42. HOW A REAL TORPEDO IS MADE.</div>
</div>

<p>The force that drives the torpedo from the tube is
our old friend <i>compressed air</i>, and this is taken from
the <i>torpedo air tanks</i> of the submarine; they are placed
just above the torpedo tube and are connected with the
rear part of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i_108b.jpg" width="342" height="103" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_43"></a>FIG. 43. THE TORPEDO TUBE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Shooting the Torpedo.</i>—Now let’s see just what
happens from the moment an enemy ship is sighted
up to the time the torpedo hits it and explodes.</p>

<p>An up-to-date torpedo makes about 40 knots, and
it will travel about six miles before its compressed air
is used up. But it cannot be aimed and shot with certainty
at a distance of over half a mile. So when an
enemy ship is sighted, the submarine creeps up upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
her, with nothing but her periscope out of the water,
until she is within accurate shooting range.</p>

<p>In the meantime the speed of the enemy ship has
been calculated, the depth at which the torpedo must
travel to strike the ship below the water-line has been
determined, and the angle, or course, the torpedo must
take to hit the ship is figured out.</p>

<p>Due allowance must be made for the speed of the
ship and the speed of the torpedo to the end that the
distance both will travel in a given time may be known.
Of course, if the ship is speeding along and the torpedo
is shot point-blank at her it will pass a good
many yards astern of her.</p>

<p>This operation is very much like that of rabbit
hunting, in which you do not fire directly at the running
rabbit, but aim several feet ahead of him, and he
simply runs into the bullet or shot. So it’s all his
fault if he gets killed. Just so with the ship and the
torpedo; for instead of the torpedo running into the
ship, the ship runs into the torpedo, and so if the ship
sinks it isn’t the fault of the torpedo—or at least that
is the way the German captain of a U-boat looks at it.</p>

<p>Before the torpedo is loaded into the torpedo tube
the safety pin is taken out of the firing pin and the butterfly-nut
is loosened so that it will unscrew easily.
The torpedo is then slipped into the tube and the
<i>breach-block</i> of the tube is closed. The compressed
air is now turned on at the torpedo air tank; when the
air rushes into the torpedo tube behind the torpedo,
but the latter is kept from being forced out by a lock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Course of the Torpedo.</i>—Next the captain
sights his ship and finds its speed and its distance
from his own craft. To direct the torpedo so that it
will hit her target fairly, an instrument called a <i>torpedo
director</i> is used. It is shown in <a href="#FIG_44">Fig. 44</a>, and this
picture also shows how the torpedo and the ship come
together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<a href="images/i_110-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="468" height="369" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_44"></a>FIG. 44. HOW THE TORPEDO DIRECTOR WORKS.</div>
</div>

<p>Now as the torpedo tube is fixed in the hull of the
submarine the <i>whole craft</i> must be turned and aimed
at the enemy ship. To do this the <i>torpedo arm</i> of the
director is set parallel with the torpedo tube; then the
<i>torpedo speed scale</i> is adjusted at the speed that the
torpedo makes and which is known.</p>

<p>The speed of the distant ship having been calculated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the <i>ship speed scale</i> is set at that speed and parallel
to the ship’s course, and this brings the sight arm in
line with the observer’s eye and the line that the ship
is sailing.</p>

<p>When the ship crosses the line of sight the catch of
the lock is released, the compressed air blows the torpedo
out of its tube, and away she goes. The instant
the torpedo has left the tube the engine and other contrivances
start to work and it then moves swiftly and
surely over a straight course.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 482px;">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="482" height="214" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_45"></a>FIG. 45. THE GARDINER CURRENT-CONTROLLED TORPEDO.</div>
</div>

<p>Long before the torpedo reaches its goal the butterfly-nut
drops off, and so when it strikes the ship the
firing pin which projects out of the warhead is pushed
back with a deal of force and explodes the charge
which either sinks the ship or cripples it.</p>

<p><b>A Torpedo with a Cannon in It.</b>—Lieutenant
Davis, of the U. S. N., has invented a new kind of
warhead for torpedoes, one that is even more deadly
than the style I have described.</p>

<p>It is made by placing a cannon in the warhead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
When the torpedo strikes the ship the cannon shoots
a projectile clear through the hull and into the inside
of the ship, where it explodes. As the projectile is
fitted with a <i>time fuse</i>, it does not explode until it
gets well into the ship, and then it does far more damage
than the old-style of warhead, which explodes just
as it strikes the hull. The projectile is loaded with 250
pounds of guncotton or TNT but the warhead is not
loaded at all.</p>

<p>On the submarines that are now being built cradles
which hold several extra torpedoes are fitted to the
decks, and in this way the number of torpedoes which
can be shot is increased.</p>

<div class="faux">CHAPTER VI<br />

MAKING THE SUBMARINE DEADLIER</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would naturally be supposed that a submarine
carrying eight or more torpedoes is about as destructive
an engine as human ingenuity could devise; but
not so, for there are other <i>munitions</i> of warfare with
which it is equipped that make it even deadlier.</p>

<p>Now, the word <i>munitions</i> means war materials of
every kind—except, of course, men and money; but
on a submarine the munitions are limited to (1) the
<i>automobile torpedo</i>, which we have described in the
last chapter; (2) <i>rapid-fire machine guns</i>, and (3)
<i>submarine mines</i>.</p>

<p>In the present war Germany has undertaken the gigantic
task of sinking all the merchantmen, not only
of the Allies but of the neutral countries as well, and
it is this U-boat policy which has brought her into a
state of war with nearly every civilized country on
the face of the earth.</p>

<p>As the torpedo is such a costly weapon, it would not
do to waste it on sinking any but the largest ships, or
those carrying valuable cargoes; but the same policy of
Germany, which is to starve out the Allies, also calls
for sinking the smaller craft, such as trawlers and unarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
merchantmen, and this is done by means of
<i>rapid-fire machine guns</i>.</p>

<p>These guns are mounted fore and aft on the deck of
the submarine, and they are used to bring down small
ships and also to enable the undersea craft to defend
herself against <i>submarine chasers</i>, airplanes, or occasionally
when she is surprised by a destroyer or other
armed ship which may get within firing range and attack
her before she has time to dive.</p>

<p>The submarine mine is as old as, or older than, the
submarine boat itself; and it was probably the idea of
fixing a bomb onto or planting a mine under a ship
that led to the actual building of the first underwater
craft.</p>

<p>The mine is not, however, an explosive destroyer
which is used by the submarine boat; for she could
never get close enough to an enemy ship in these days
of electric eyes and ears to make use of one. What
the submarine does do is to play the peaceful rôle of
planting the mines—not with the idea of making two
grow where only one grew before but of making one
ship less where there was one ship more, and this is
done by blowing up the enemy ships which may chance
to pass over them.</p>

<p><b>Arming the Submarine with Guns.</b>—From what
has been said above, you will see that by the use of
rapid-fire guns poor prizes can be easily and cheaply
sunk; further, a small craft always makes a bad target
for a torpedo and thus the odds of making a miss and
losing a torpedo are very considerable. The use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rapid-fire guns is, then, a very good stroke of business,
everything considered.</p>

<p>Again, when a submarine is chased and has no time
to dive, she is in a bad way, for she is not fast enough
to escape, nor can she stop long enough to aim a torpedo
at her foe. It is easy to see, then, why her armament<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
should and does include a couple of rapid-fire
guns.</p>

<p><b>The Need of a Quick-Action Gun.</b>—With these
conditions staring them in the face, the designers of
submarines have worked hard to equip their craft with
not only rapid-firing but, what is equally as important,
<i>quick-action</i> guns.</p>

<p>To get a rapid-fire machine gun was easy, for this
type had been built by the Maxims these many years;
but to get one that could be swung or lowered under
the deck so that it would not offer resistance to the
water when the submarine was running submerged,
and then brought up and into action quickly, was
quite a different thing, and inventors are still at work
on it.</p>

<p>By this I do not want you to take it that submarines
are not provided with rapid-fire and quick-action
disappearing guns at the present time; and should you
or I take a look at them we would say that they are
99 per cent. perfect and that there is no need for
further improvement. But that is because we are
neither designers, nor builders, nor officers of undersea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
craft; and do not forget, either, that better
things are always in order.</p>

<div class="caption">A 3½ INCH SUBMARINE GUN IN ACTION SHOWING THE DECK WELL AND MANNER OF OPERATION</div>
</div>

<p>Now, there are two kinds of rapid-fire, quick-action
guns used for submarine armament and these can be
told from each other by the way they are brought into
action. They are (1) the <i>spring</i> action gun, and (2)
the <i>compressed-air</i> action gun.</p>

<p><b>The Spring Action Gun.</b>—This type of submarine
gun is made by the Krupps of Essen, Germany,
who now are building the U-boats for the Central
Powers.</p>

<p>This gun is mounted on the deck, over an opening
in it called a <i>deck-well</i>, and this arrangement allows
the gun to be stowed away in it. This is done to get
rid of the resistance the water would have on the
gun if it remained fixed on deck when the boat is running
submerged.</p>

<p>Although the deck-well is closed with hatches it is
not watertight, and the fittings, such as the sights and
range finders, are taken off to keep them from rusting
when the gun is in the well.</p>

<p>A diagrammatic sketch of the gun and its housing
is shown in <a href="#FIG_46">Fig. 46</a>; the gun is mounted on a swinging
frame by <i>trunnions</i>, and the frame is fixed to a pedestal.
A strong spring in the bottom of the well supplies
the power needed to throw the gun up and bring
it into position.</p>

<p>When housed in the well the gun lays on its back, as
shown by the dotted lines, and this presses down on
the spring. The tension of the spring is enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
force the gun up and into place the instant the catch
which holds it is released.</p>

<p>The sights and other attachments are fixed on the
gun after it is brought into position and the whole
operation of raising the gun from its well and putting
on the fixtures takes just 20 seconds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">
<a href="images/i_119-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_119.jpg" width="472" height="149" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_46"></a>FIG. 46. HOW THE KRUPP OR GERMAN SUBMARINE GUN IS MOUNTED.</div>
</div>

<p>These guns have a bore of 75 <i>millimeters</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>—equal
to 3 inches—and 88 <i>millimeters</i>—equal to 3½ inches—respectively,
and the shells they use weigh in the
neighborhood of 25 pounds.</p>

<p><b>The Compressed Air Action Gun.</b>—This kind of
submarine gun is used on British undersea boats. It
is mounted over a deck-well but inasmuch as the gun
is lowered into the well with all the fittings on it the
well has to be made watertight.</p>

<p>If you will look at <a href="#FIG_47">Fig. 47</a>, you will see how the gun
is brought into action. When compressed air is turned
on in the cylinder, it forces the plunger on which the
gun is mounted up above the level of the deck. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
gun is fitted with fixed sights and a range finder, and
is ready for use the moment it has been brought into
place above the deck, the whole operation taking only
5 seconds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 319px;">
<a href="images/i_120-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="319" height="194" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_47"></a>FIG. 47. BRITISH AND AMERICAN-STYLE DECK GUN.</div>
</div>

<p>The guns of the Allies’ submarines have bores of
3 and 4 inches, and each one weighs nearly a ton. As
a protection from enemy aircraft they have a wide
range and can, if needs be, fire a shot at 90 degrees,
that is, straight overhead.</p>

<p><b>How a Submarine Lays Mines.</b>—The dangerous
work of laying mines in an enemy harbor by a submarine
is not as spectacular as torpedoing ships but it is
an important part of the business of undersea craft.</p>

<p>A harbor which has been planted with mines to keep
out enemy ships or blow them up if they try to enter it
is often remined overnight by enemy submarines, and
in this way a great deal of damage can be done to
friendly shipping.</p>

<p>But whether the submarine is used for mining its
own or enemy harbors, the outstanding feature of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
work is that it does it all under water and therefore the
operations cannot be seen by spying eyes.</p>

<p>As we said in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>, the mines are stored in
a compartment in the hull of the submarine and this
can be shut off from the other compartments by a
bulkhead door. It also has a hatch opening through
the hull to the water outside, just as the door of a
kitchen opens into the back yard.</p>

<p>When the submarine has made its way under water
to the place where the mines are to be planted, the
hatch is opened and the mine compartment is allowed
to fill with water. A mine layer in a diving suit can
then get in and out of the flooded compartment, take
the mines one by one through the open hatch, and
place them in position.</p>

<p>Then there are mines which do not need to be set by
a mine layer; these are simply dropped through the
hatch into the water and adjust themselves as to depth.
Other mines are made that are shot from the torpedo
tubes by compressed air and these are used for mining
an enemy harbor where the risks of having the submarine
blown up is altogether too great to take the
chance.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Submarine Mines.</b>—Submarine mines—that
is, mines that are planted in harbors and other
seaways, either as a protection from enemy ships or
as an offensive measure to blow them up—really have
nothing to do with submarine boats except that the
latter are used to lay them. But you ought to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
about submarine mines, anyway, and so we’ll digress a
little and tell you something of them.</p>

<p>First of all, there are two distinct kinds of mines
and these are, (1) <i>contact mines</i>, and (2) <i>electrically
controlled mines</i>.</p>

<p>As you can tell by its name a contact mine is one
that is exploded by the hull of a ship coming in contact
with it—that is, by running against it. This is the
kind of mine that is most often laid by the submarine.</p>

<p>An electrically controlled mine is one that is exploded
by electricity. For this purpose a pair of wires
are connected to it and these lead along the bottom of
the harbor to two <i>observation stations</i> on the shore;
when the enemy ship gets directly over the mine the
observers close the electric circuit and the mine is
exploded.</p>

<p>This is the way the <i>Maine</i> was sunk in Havana harbor
in 1898, but the <i>Maine</i> was not an enemy ship.
The result of this rash bit of foolishness led to the
war between the United States and Spain, and the loss
of her island possessions.</p>

<p><b>How the Mines Are Made.</b>—<i>The contact mine.</i>—This
kind of a mine consists of a steel shell, or container,
which holds the charge of high explosive, the
trigger mechanism which explodes it when a ship
strikes it, and the weights and cables needed to sink
the mine to the right depth. Air chambers are also
placed inside the container, to give the mine buoyancy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
otherwise it would sink at once to the bottom of the
sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/i_123.jpg" width="316" height="245" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_48"></a>FIG. 48. A SIMPLE CONTACT MINE.</div>
</div>

<p>In the contact mine the detonator is formed of an
arm, or lever, called a <i>striker</i>, and this projects through
the shell to the outside. When a ship strikes the arm
it drives a <i>firing pin</i> against a <i>percussion cap</i> and explodes
it, and this in turn fires the explosive charge
in the mine. (See <a href="#FIG_48">Fig. 48</a>.)</p>

<p><i>How the Contact Mine Works.</i>—The way the mine
works is like this: Before it is taken out of the compartment
of the submarine it is adjusted to float at
the proper depth.</p>

<p>When the mine is in the water a weight that it carries
is released and sinks to the bottom; the cable
which connects the weight and the mine together holds
the mine in the right position, while the air tanks in
the mine make it rise as high as the cable will let it
go, as shown in <a href="#FIG_49">Fig. 49</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>After the mine is planted, the submarine steals silently
and invisibly away. When an enemy ship—or
any other, for that matter, for the contact mine is no
respecter of ships—strikes the trigger of the mine, it
explodes the charge, and there is one less ship to sail
the turquoise seas.</p>

<p><i>The Electric Controlled Mine.</i>—To the end that a
harbor can be planted with mines which will blow up
enemy ships and yet be harmless to friendly ships,
mines fired by electricity from the shore were invented.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="386" height="249" alt="diagrams" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_49"></a>FIG. 49. HOW THE MINE ADJUSTS ITSELF.</div>
</div>

<p>Mines of this kind are made about like contact
mines in that they contain an explosive charge and a
detonator, but they are much larger and far more
powerful, for they have to be laid on the bed of the
harbor, and instead of being fired by a pin striking a
percussion cap they are fired by an electric spark.</p>

<p>From each mine laid in the harbor a pair of insulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
copper wires run to the shore, and this electric
circuit connects with two shore stations at a distance
apart and which with the mine form a triangle.
The electric circuit has a key in it at each shore station,
and to explode the mine both of these keys must
be pressed down at the same time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="467" height="377" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_50"></a>FIG. 50. HOW THE ELECTRIC MINE WORKS.</div>
</div>

<p>Each shore station has a telescope fixed in position
so that its <i>line of sight</i> (shown by the dotted lines in
<a href="#FIG_50">Fig. 50</a>) passes directly over the mine. Now when an
enemy ship approaches, each observer will see it when
it sails on or across his line of sight and he will press
his key. But it is necessary that <i>both</i> observers see the
ship at the <i>same</i> time that it is at the point where
their lines of sight cross, and consequently directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
over the mine, and when this happens they will both
press their keys, the circuit will be closed, the electric
current will fire the mine, and the ship will change her
course to one straight up and speed with all possible
haste to the port whence no ship ever clears again.</p>

THE WONDERFUL EYE OF THE SUBMARINE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the gravest faults the pilots of the first submarines
had to contend with was that they were not
able to see where their craft was going.</p>

<p>But like everything else that is needed for the welfare
or warfare of the human race, inventors got busy
and began to scheme and to experiment, with the big
idea of making an instrument which would do for the
submarine what the eye does for the brain, and that
is to <i>look around</i> with.</p>

<p><b>How the Eye of the Submarine Got Its Name.</b>—Now,
the eye of the submarine is called a <i>periscope</i>
and before we go any further let us find out how it
came to get this peculiar name for then we shall know
more of what we are talking about.</p>

<p>The early Greeks used two words that were very
common to them, and you, too, will use them, before
you get through with this chapter, just as easily as
they did. One of these words is <i>peri</i> which means
<i>around</i>, and the other is <i>scopeō</i> which means to <i>look</i>;
so <i>peri</i> plus <i>scopeō</i> means to <i>around look</i>, or, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
barbarians say it, <i>look around</i>—which sounds better
to us. And there you have the roots of the word
<i>periscope</i>.</p>

<p><b>The First Submarine Eye, or Periscope.</b>—As in
the beginning of all things, good and evil, the first attempts
to make an eye for the submarine, or a periscope,
were very crude, and as usual they were nearly,
if not quite worthless.</p>

<p>But the periscope was no exception to the first law
of invention, and that is that each attempt, however
much of a failure it may have been in itself, had the
germ of a useful device in it; and from out of all these
efforts finally came that wonderful optical instrument,
the periscope.</p>

<p>We say <i>wonderful</i> because with it an observer in the
conning tower of a modern submarine, though it is
all but submerged, can see everything that is taking
place on the surface of the water around the whole
horizon.</p>

<p>The earliest trials at making a periscope were by
using a simple arrangement of mirrors of an “L”
tube and each at an angle of 45 degrees. The best
way to understand its construction is to make one for
yourself.</p>

<p><b>How to Make a Simple Periscope.</b>—You can get
a lot of fun out of this home-made periscope,
and with it you can <i>out-sherlock</i> Sherlock Holmes, the
great detective who was invented by Conan Doyle,
for you can see around corners, over fences, and even
back of yourself just as though you had a movable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
third eye, and without so much as ever being seen
yourself.</p>

<p>Make a tube of wood or cardboard 2 inches square
and 12 inches long, as shown in <a href="#FIG_51">Fig. 51</a>. Fit two
square pieces of looking-glass into the corners of the
tube at 45 degrees—that is half way between the vertical
and the horizontal—and your periscope is finished
and ready for use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 203px;">
<a href="images/i_131-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="203" height="317" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_51"></a>FIG. 51. HOW TO MAKE A SIMPLE MIRROR PERISCOPE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>How the Periscope Works.</i>—When, now, you hold
the long tube of your periscope in a vertical position
that is straight up and down, and the light from an
object, a person, or a scene at which the upper horizontal
tube, or <i>objective</i>, as it is called, is pointed,
strikes the first mirror, it bends the rays of light at an
angle of 90 degrees, when the light goes straight down
the tube as shown by the arrows in <a href="#FIG_51">Fig. 51</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>When it strikes the other and lower mirror, the
rays of light are again turned out of their path at an
angle of 90 degrees, when they are reflected out of
the lower horizontal tube which forms the <i>eye-piece</i>.</p>

<p>If now you will place your eye to this end of the
tube, you will be able to look all around and see what
you shall see. See?</p>

<p><b>The Modern Lenticular<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Periscope.</b>—The toy
periscope which we have just described, and which we
hope you will make and use, does not show what is
going on at any great distance, and while this will
not interfere with your pleasure of using it, it mattered
very greatly when it was used as an eye for a
submarine craft.</p>

<p>To be able to see farther led to the idea of using a
telescope in connection with the mirrors in the tube,
and a periscope of this kind was next made and tried
out, and, let it be said, the results obtained were a
decided improvement as against those where mirrors
alone were used.</p>

<p><b>How the Telescope Is Made.</b>—You may or may
not know it, but an ordinary telescope, or <i>spy-glass</i>,
as it is called, is made up of four lenses, as shown
in <a href="#FIG_52">Fig. 52</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the large lens in the front end of the
tube—or <i>object glass</i>, to call it by its right name—is
to gather in the light of the object and form an image
of it. The small lens in the back end of the tube is
used to magnify the image formed by the object glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, when a telescope has only an object-glass and
an eye-piece, the magnified image of the object looked
at is always upside down; this is the kind of telescope
that astronomers use in their star work and the fact
that the image is reversed doesn’t really matter anyway
because the man in the moon looks about as well
when he is standing on his head as he does when he
is right side up.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_52"></a>FIG. 52. HOW AN ORDINARY TERRESTRIAL TELESCOPE IS MADE
AND WORKS.</div>
</div>

<p>But when you want to look at objects here on the
earth’s surface you want to see them as they are and
not upside down. To <i>rectify the image</i>, which means
to make the eye see the object as it is, two more
lenses are placed in the tube, and so four lenses are
used in all.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><i>About the Reflecting Prisms.</i>—The next big improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in periscopes came when a <i>total reflecting
prism</i> was used in the place of the mirror at each end
of the tube.</p>

<p>In <i>physics</i> the terms <i>total reflecting</i> means simply
that <i>all</i> of the light that strikes a surface is reflected
again without loss. While a mirror will reflect only a
part of the light that falls on it, a <i>prism</i> will reflect all
of the light that enters it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_53"></a>FIG. 53. THE REFLECTING PRISM.</div>
</div>

<p>A prism is a three-sided piece of glass, if you forget
to count the ends, as shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#FIG_53">Fig. 53</a>.
When a ray of light enters, say, the vertical side of
the prism it keeps on going until it strikes the 45-degree
side of it; this side reflects and bends it and it passes
out of the horizontal side, as shown at <i>B</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_54"></a>FIG. 54. HOW A MODERN PERISCOPE IS MADE AND WORKS.</div>
</div>
<p><i>The Construction of the Periscope.</i>—Knowing now
how a telescope is made and what it does and also
knowing what a prism is and how it acts on light, all
you have to do to understand the construction of a
submarine periscope is to take a good look at <a href="#FIG_54">Fig. 54</a>.</p>

<p>You will see that a prism is fixed in the upper end of
the tube and directly back of the object-glass; that
another prism is fixed to the lower end of the tube and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
back of the eye-piece; and that the rectifying lenses of
the telescope are set between these two prisms. This
picture also shows the path of the light through it.</p>


<p>These lenses and prisms are mounted in a tube about
4 inches in diameter and 20 feet long. A horizontal
revolving hood is secured to the upper end of the
tube and the horizontal eye-piece is fastened to the
lower end of it; a wheel is also fixed to the lower
end of the tube, so that the observer can turn the periscope
completely around and so scan the surface of
the sea in any direction.</p>

<p>The periscope tube is placed in a slightly larger and
very strong steel tube, which passes through the
deck of the conning tower and into the latter, and
it is made watertight by means of a <i>stuffing-box</i>.</p>

<p>The reason it is necessary to have a fixed outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
tube is because the force of the water, when the craft
is submerged and is speeding along under power,
presses against the tube so hard that if only the inside
one were used it would bind; as it is, there is no pressure
on the inside tube and it can therefore turn freely
at all times.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LATEST TYPE OF PERISCOPE. A MUCH MAGNIFIED IMAGE
OF THE OBJECT IS SHOWN IN THE INNER CIRCLE, WHILE IN THE
OUTER CIRCLE IS SHOWN THE OBJECT PLUS AN “ALL ROUND”
VIEW OF THE HORIZON. A SUBMARINE FITTED WITH THIS
PERISCOPE MAY WELL BE SAID TO HAVE EYES IN THE BACK OF
ITS HEAD</div>
</div>

<p>All recently built submarines have two periscopes,
one of which leads into the conning tower and the
other one runs down into the navigating room. Hence
if one or the other is put out of commission by shell-fire,
or otherwise, the submarine can still see and find
its way about.</p>

<p><i>Gauging the Distance of an Enemy Ship.</i>—An instrument
called a <i>telemeter</i> (pronounced te-lem´-e-ter) is
attached to the periscope near the eye-piece, and the
observer can by looking into it measure the distance
away of an enemy ship. This is done from the size
of the image it makes on the eye-piece.</p>

<p>Without this instrument the whole submarine, as
large, as wonderful, and as costly as it is, would be
of small value, for by it the captain is able to set his
torpedo director very accurately and hence to aim the
torpedo so that it will make a sure hit.</p>


<p><b>The Latest Type of Periscope.</b>—As the periscope
just described, and which is still in use on submarines,
has a very limited <i>field of vision</i> at any given
setting—that is to say, only about ⅙ th of the horizon
can be seen when the instrument is pointed one way—and
as a periscope which would show the whole horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at the same time was badly needed, a British firm
of opticians set out to invent one.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the task was not to get a
complete view of the whole horizon at the same time
but to prevent the rays of light which form the images
from getting mixed up with one another, or <i>interfering</i>,
and so producing a blurred and indistinct picture.</p>

<p>The new complete-view periscope differs from the
older style only in having a circular lens and prism;
these gather in the light, bend the rays and project
them on down through the telescope lens until they
reach the lower prism when all of the images are reflected
into the eye-piece where the observer sees it
as a circular picture.</p>

<p>This new improved form of periscope is of great
value, for it gives a safety-first view on all sides of
the submarine at the same time and the observer does
not need to keep turning the eye-piece, and this is of
great value when a submarine is being closed in on
by two or more enemy ships.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that a large number of submarine
accidents have been caused by the limited range
of view offered by the old-style periscope, and in
some cases the undersea craft has been rammed or sunk
by gun-fire from an enemy ship which she did not
see.</p>

<p>The new periscope makes it impossible for a destroyer
to creep up on the submarine without being
caught in the act. Nearly all of the undersea craft
now being turned out by all of the warring nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
are fitted with the new 360-degree<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> vision periscope.</p>

<p><b>The Limited Use of the Periscope.</b>—Notwithstanding
all these latest improvements in the periscope,
its use is quite limited, for it can be used only when
the submarine is running awash or partly submerged,
and since the tube of the instrument is only 20 feet
high the distance to which a ship can be seen is about
five miles.</p>

<p>When running partly submerged the tube of the periscope
sticks up and out of the water about 10 feet,
when the distance range of vision is then cut down to
about two miles, for the curvature of the earth’s surface
meets the line of sight and everything that is
at a greater distance than this from the submarine is
below the horizon and hence invisible.</p>

<p>Should an enemy destroyer get within firing range
of the submarine and the captain of the latter craft
wants to watch it, only the hood of the periscope is
poked up above the water; but of course the distance
range is again cut down.</p>

<p>The captain of a submarine has to contend with all
these adverse features of the periscope even on bright,
clear days and when the sea is calm; on dark and
foggy days, when a heavy sea is running, the periscope
is next to useless, for the mist and spray gather
on the objective lenses and this makes it next to impossible
to see anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Worst of all are the waves which break over the
periscope, and this prevents a ship from being seen
even if it is only a little way off. It is in rough weather
that a submarine takes the longest chances; but to put
behind him any danger that may be lurking hard by,
the captain prefers to run undersea and come to the
surface only when he has to.</p>

<p>A scheme to clear the moisture from the objective
lenses is a device called a <i>sprayer</i>. It is made and
worked so that an observer at the periscope can spray
the lenses with alcohol. As water has a very great
liking—or <i>affinity</i>, as it is called—for alcohol, and as
alcohol evaporates almost instantly it carries the particles
of water off with it, and this helps to make the
<i>seeing</i> better.</p>

<p><b>The New Enemy of the Submarine.</b>—A new
enemy of the submarine has recently made its appearance—an
enemy that will make it use a periscope of a
new order.</p>

<p>This latest submarine destroyer is the airplane;
and as the captain cannot now see directly overhead
except when his boat is running light or awash, and the
pilot of an airplane can see the submarine when it is
submerged to a very considerable depth, it is easy for
him to follow the undersea craft until she comes to the
surface and then drop a bomb on her.</p>

<p>A story of a running fight between an airplane and
a submarine would have put it in Col. Roosevelt’s
<i>Ananias Club</i> a few years ago, but to-day it has all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
come to pass, and it looks now as if a good way to
break the backbone of Germany’s ruthless warfare on
the sea is to destroy the U-boats with a fleet of airplanes.</p>

THE MARVELOUS TONGUE AND EARS OF
THE SUBMARINE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> a submarine has an eye to see with, it is both
proper and fitting that it should have a tongue so that
it may speak and ears so that it may hear. In fact,
an undersea boat is almost human.</p>

<p>The early submarine, though, was not only as
blind as a cave fish, but it was as deaf and as dumb
as a snail; and since this was the case, it had to do
whatever talking was necessary by means of a deaf
and dumb alphabet, that is, by signaling with flags,
or <i>wigwagging</i>, as it is called.</p>

<p><b>The Tongue and Ears of a Submarine.</b>—The
tongue of a submarine—or rather tongues, for it has
several—is the fanciful name I have given to the
means, methods, and schemes by which messages are
sent from one submarine to another submarine or to
shore, and the ears are the devices by which it receives
messages from other submarines and from shore stations.</p>

<p>There are two conditions under which messages
must be sent from and received by a submarine, and
these are (1) when she is running light or awash, and
(2) when she is running submerged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, most of the signaling systems can be used
only when the submarine is on the surface, and a couple
of them can be used only when she is under water.</p>

<p>Then, again, some systems are good only for daylight
signaling, and others for night signaling; others
will cover very short distances, but there are systems
that will send and receive over long distances. But
whatever the system may be there will be found some
weak point in it as far as the submarine is concerned.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Signaling Systems.</b>—Since no one signaling
system will meet the rigid requirements of the
submarine, several systems are used. When the craft is
on the surface, these are: (1) the <i>flag</i>, or <i>wigwag</i>,
system; (2) the <i>flashlight</i> system; and (3) the <i>wireless
telegraph</i> system. When the submarine is under water
the signaling systems used are: (1) the <i>bell</i>, or <i>violin</i>,
system; and (2) the <i>electric current</i> system—all of
these will be described in order and as we go along.</p>

<p><b>The Wigwag Way of Signaling.</b>—The oldest
way of sending messages at sea is by <i>wigwagging</i>,
that is, using flags, and this system is still in use in
the navies of all nations for close range daylight
communication.</p>

<p>The way wigwagging is done is like this: Each
craft has a signal book which gives the positions of
the flags and the meaning of them. These flags are
usually manipulated by a signalman (see <a href="#FIG_55">Fig. 55</a>)
though sometimes a mechanical apparatus called a
<i>semaphore</i>, which has two movable arms to hold the
flags, is used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;">
<img src="images/i_145.jpg" width="478" height="505" alt="drawing of man on deck using semaphore" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_55"></a>FIG. 55. SIGNALING BY MEANS OF FLAGS.</div>
</div>

<p>Two flags are used, one in each hand or on each arm,
and each position of the flags means a letter of the alphabet,
and so by showing the flags in various positions
to represent different letters words are spelled
out.</p>

<p>Another scheme that is used to signal with flags is
by running, that is displaying, a number of different
colored flags on a <i>halyard</i>. The combinations of
flags—or to use the right word, <i>permutation</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
means the number of different arrangements of a few
flags that are possible—are numerous and each permutation
represents some word or a sea-term.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that it would take a couple of
hundred flags of different colors to represent a message,
and, further, that since there are only eight
colors which can be told from each other at a distance
of half a mile, signaling by colors could not be done.</p>

<p>But this is what you think, and not what you have
figured out, for if you have eight flags of different
colors and display them, four at a time, on the signal
halyard you can make the surprising number of 1680
permutations; and this, you will allow, is enough to
say anything that you may have to say.</p>

<p>Although a <i>code book</i> is found in every signalman’s
outfit, he is a chap who knows all the signals by heart
and can send and receive flag messages almost as fast
as you can write down the words.</p>

<p><b>The Flashlight System.</b>—There are two methods
used for sending signals at night over short distances,
and both are done by means of light; named, these are
(1) the <i>colored light</i> system, and (2) the <i>searchlight</i>
system.</p>

<p><i>The Colored Light System.</i>—In this system incandescent
electric lights of high candle power are placed
back of <i>bull’s-eyes</i>, or lenses, made of colored glass,
and these lights can be switched on and off and so form
combinations that spell out words just as the colored
flags do. This system is very much used for short
range signaling at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Searchlight System.</i>—A searchlight, that is an
electric arc light set in front of a silvered reflector,
can be seen for long distances, and so it, too, is largely
used for night signaling.</p>

<p>The searchlight, which can be turned in any direction,
has a movable <i>shutter</i>, or metal disk in front of
it, fixed to a handle, and when this is worked up and
down like a telegraph key, the shutter cuts the light
off and lets it shine forth accordingly.</p>

<p>By working the key, and hence the shutter, the light
is broken up into dots and dashes of the regular Morse
telegraph alphabet, and these short and long flashes are
read by the operator on the other boat.</p>

<p><b>The Wireless Telegraph System.</b>—The wireless
telegraph has all the other systems of signaling, when
the submarine is afloat, beaten by miles.</p>

<p>Among its advantages are (1) it can be used in the
daytime as well as at night; (2) the electric waves it
sends out cannot be seen and this makes it harder for
an enemy ship to locate the boat it is on, and (3) its
signaling range is not cut off by the curvature of the
earth.</p>

<p><i>The Parts of a Wireless System.</i>—There are three
chief parts to every wireless telegraph system, and
these are (1) the sending apparatus, or <i>transmitter</i>, as
it is called; (2) the receiving apparatus, or <i>receptor</i>, as
some “high-brow” has named it; and (3) the <i>aerial
wire</i>, which is used for both sending and receiving.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_56"></a>FIG. 56. A, THE TRANSMITTER READY TO SEND. B, THE RECEIVER
READY TO LISTEN IN.</div>
</div>

<p>The sending apparatus is made up of (a) a <i>source
of current</i>, which on a submarine is the storage battery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a><br /><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
(b) an <i>induction coil</i>; (c) a <i>telegraph key</i>; (d) a
<i>tuning coil</i>; and (e) a <i>condenser</i>.</p>

<p>The receiving apparatus is formed of (a) a <i>tuning
coil</i>; (b) a <i>condenser</i>; (c) a <i>detector</i>; and (d) a pair
of <i>head telephone receivers</i>. A wireless telegraph set
is shown in <a href="#FIG_56">Fig. 56</a>, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>Both the sending and the receiving apparatus can be
connected with the aerial wire by means of what is
called a <i>throw-over</i> switch, the purpose of which is to
connect the <i>aerial</i> to the transmitter when messages
are to be sent out and to connect the aerial to the receiver
when messages are to be received. Thus only
one aerial is needed.</p>

<p><i>How Wireless Works</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>—When a wireless message
is sent the operator makes and breaks up the current
from the storage battery into dots and dashes by means
of the telegraph key.</p>

<p><i>This interrupted low pressure current</i> flows through
the induction coil and this changes it into a <i>high pressure
current</i> which makes a <i>jump spark</i>. The spark in
turn changes the high pressure current into <i>high frequency
currents</i>, or <i>electric oscillations</i>, as they are
called; and as these run forth and back over the
aerial wire they set up waves in the <i>ether</i> which are
called <i>electric waves</i>.</p>

<p>These electric waves are exactly like light waves,
but they are so long that the eye cannot see them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
tuning coil and the condenser are used to give the
waves whatever length the government says they must
have.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><i>Courtesy of Hilbourne and Clark Mfg. Co.</i></div>

<div class="caption">A MARINE WIRELESS INSTALLATION</div>
</div>
<p>When the electric waves that are sent out by the
aerial of the transmitting station strike the aerial which
is connected with the receiving apparatus of another
ship and the operator is <i>listening in</i>, the waves are
changed back again into high frequency currents, and
these run to and fro on the aerial wire and up and
down through the tuning coil, the condenser and the
detector.</p>

<p>The latter instrument changes the high frequency
currents, which are alternating, into an interrupted direct
current; and these in turn <i>energize</i> the telephone
receiver, with the result that the dots and dashes sent
out by the sending operator are reproduced by the telephone
receiver, when they are heard by the receiving
operator who is <i>listening in</i>.</p>

<p>The tuning coil and condenser enable the operator
to <i>tune</i> his receiving apparatus to the length of wave
which the transmitting station is sending out, and this
operation is called <i>tuning in</i>.</p>

<p>The wireless station of a submarine is usually located
in the navigation compartment. Although the
aerial is neither high nor long, messages can be sent to
upwards of two hundred miles and received over much
greater distances.</p>

<p>Wireless allows the submarine not only to keep in
touch with its <i>base</i> but also to pick up and intercept
messages from enemy ships, and though the operator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
may not be able to decipher them it is possible for him
to determine in about what direction and at about
what distance the ship is.</p>



<p>Another use to which wireless is put is signaling
between submarines that are doing patrol duty at the
same time but which are too far away from each other
to use either flags or lights.</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy cannot, however, be used when
the submarine is under water, for water absorbs the
electric waves in exactly the same way that it absorbs
light waves. But taken all in all, wireless is by far
the most important of all the signaling systems yet
invented, and it is the only one by which messages
can be sent and received by either day or night, over
long distances and in any kind of weather.</p>

<p><b>Underwater Signaling Systems.</b>—As I have said
before, there are two kinds of signaling systems used
by a submarine when it is under water.</p>

<p>While both systems leave much to be desired—for
neither can begin to come up to wireless, either in
ease of operation or in signaling range—as they are
the only known means by which underwater communication
is possible, there is nothing to do but to use
them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 133px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_57"></a>FIG. 57. THE SUBMARINE BELL.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Bell or Violin System.</i>—This is a signaling
system that is widely used on ocean going vessels of
all kinds to send out warning signals in thick weather.</p>

<p>It is a system in which a large bell or other vibrating
apparatus sets up sound waves which travel in
every direction through the water; when these waves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
reach another craft they are heard by means of a telephone
receiving apparatus.</p>

<p>Now, water will carry sound about ten times as
far and four times as fast as air; that is to say, if a
bell is struck a blow in air and the sound waves it
sends forth can be heard a distance of half a mile,
then the same bell if it is struck when it is submerged
in water will send out waves to a distance of five
miles.</p>

<p>The sending apparatus consists of either a bell (see
<a href="#FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>), the striking mechanism of which is worked
by electricity, or of a large saw-toothed wheel which
revolves rapidly against a tight wire and in consequence
sets up a musical note. This latter kind is
called a <i>violin transmitter</i>.</p>

<p>Whichever is used is lowered through a hatch in the
hull of the submarine, and the bell is rung or the wheel
is rotated by an electro-mechanism, which sends out
sound waves to distances of from 5 to 15 miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The receiving apparatus (shown in <a href="#FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>) is
formed of an ordinary <i>telephone transmitter</i>, and this
is fixed in a small iron tank filled with water and bolted
to the inside of the skin of the hull. There is one
of these transmitters on each side of the ship, and each
one is connected with a battery and a pair of head
telephone receivers placed in the navigating compartment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<a href="images/i_153-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_153.jpg" width="468" height="275" alt="diagram of sound waves" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_58"></a>FIG. 58. HOW THE SENDING AND RECEIVING BELL SYSTEM WORKS.</div>
</div>

<p>When the bell or violin of another submarine, or
the base ship, sends out its message in the Morse alphabet
the sound waves, as you will see by looking at <a href="#FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>,
travel through the water and strike the hull of the
ship, go through its skin, set the water to vibrating in
the tank, and this, acting on the telephone transmitter,
makes it vary the electric current of the battery; the
varying current flowing through the telephone receivers
reproduces the distant sound of the bell or the violin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
wheel, and the operator on the submarine hears it.</p>

<p>The receiving apparatus also serves to detect the
presence of an enemy ship when it comes within torpedoing
range by the sound waves set up by and by
which are sent out through the water by the rapid turning
of the ship’s <i>propellers</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Electric Current, or Conductivity, System.</b>—In
this submarine telegraph system the water, which
is a fairly good conductor of electricity, is made to
carry an ordinary battery current between the sending
and the receiving stations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<a href="images/i_154-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_154.jpg" width="463" height="260" alt="another diagram of soundwaves" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_59"></a>FIG. 59. THE UNDERWATER “WIRELESS.”</div>
</div>

<p>Since the water conducts the current of electricity,
it is easy to see why it is called a <i>conductivity</i> system.
It is also called an <i>underwater wireless</i> system, but
while it is <i>wireless</i> in the sense that there are no connecting
wires between the two stations, you must not
confuse it with the <i>real</i> wireless system, which uses
electric waves, for in the former the energy decreases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
as the <i>cube</i> of the distance and in the latter only as the
<i>square</i> of the distance.</p>

<p><i>The Parts of the Conductivity System.</i>—There are
three principal parts to this system, and these are (1)
the <i>sending</i> apparatus; (2) the <i>receiving</i> apparatus,
and (3) the <i>submerged copper plates</i> which conduct
the current from the sender into the water and from
the water into the receptor.</p>

<p>The sending apparatus consists of (a) a <i>source of
direct current</i>, and the storage battery supplies this;
(b) a <i>reactance</i>, or <i>kick coil</i>, as it is commonly called;
(c) a <i>rotating interruptor</i>, and (d) an ordinary <i>telegraph
key</i>.</p>

<p>The receiving apparatus is made up of (a) a <i>telephone
induction coil</i>, and (b) a pair of <i>head telephone
receivers</i>. All of this is shown in <a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>.</p>

<p>One of the submerged copper plates is fixed to the
bow of the submarine’s hull, and the other is secured
to the stern, in order to get the plates as far apart
as possible. These plates are connected to a <i>throw-over
switch</i>, so that either the sender or the receptor
can be connected to the plates as the operator wishes.</p>

<p><i>How the System Works.</i>—The instruments of the
sending apparatus are connected up as shown in <a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>.
Now when a message is to be sent from one submarine
to another, the operator sets the rotary interruptor,
which is run by an electric motor, to spinning,
and this makes and breaks the current several hundred
times a minute as long as he holds the key down which
closes the circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The result is that each dot and dash he makes is
formed of a large number of separate currents, and
as these flow through the reactance coil, it gives each
one a little kick and sends it out into the water through
the copper plates; the currents then spread out between
and from the plates in closed lines which extend
to very considerable distances, as shown in <a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>.</p>

<p>When these electric currents reach the plates of the
receiving apparatus on the submarine where the operator
is <i>listening in</i>, they flow up the wires and through
the primary winding of the <i>telephone induction</i> coil;
these broken up <i>direct currents</i> flowing through the
<i>primary</i> coil set up <i>alternating currents</i> in the <i>secondary</i>
coil and also raise the <i>low pressure currents</i> into
<i>high pressure</i> currents—that is, currents of a higher
<i>voltage</i>, as it is called.</p>

<p>These alternating high pressure currents then flow
through the telephone receiver, and by varying the
strength of the magnet of the latter the dots and
dashes of the sending station are reproduced and the
receiving operator hears them as a musical buzz.</p>

<div class="faux">CHAPTER IX<br />

THE CREW OF THE SUBMARINE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will remember, back there in the first chapter,
we told you about Fulton’s submarine and how one
man operated it, so naturally he was his own superior
officer and able-bodied seaman both rolled into one.</p>

<p>Since those early days of underwater navigation
wonderful advances have been made, not only in submarine
construction, but in the crew that mans her
as well, for not only are there many men in the crew
of a submarine of to-day, but each man is highly
trained for the work he has to do.</p>

<p>At the present time the <i>personnel</i>, which means the
force of men employed as well as their fighting qualities
taken as a whole, includes a list of no less than
48 officers and seamen, and each and every one of
them is a picked man. The smaller submarines, of
course, carry a smaller <i>complement</i> of men, for there
is neither as much work to be done nor is there room
to bunk them.</p>

<p><b>Conditions on Early Submarine Craft.</b>—What
with the great array of instruments, apparatus, and
machines that must form the equipment of the submarine
to make her an efficient fighting unit, there is but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
little space left in her for her crew, and this was especially
so in the early days.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that space was, and still is, at a
premium, the crew of a submarine does not list a man
who has not one or more important parts to play in
the actual operation of the boat; for every addition
to the crew means that much less comfort for each
one, and interferes moreover, with the carrying out of
orders in a rapid and effective manner.</p>

<p><b>When Crews Were Hard to Sign.</b>—There were
no conveniences provided on the first submarines for
their crews; indeed, as we look back now on those
pioneer attempts, it seems verily as if no thought at
all was given to the health and safety of the men who
manned them.</p>

<p>It was enough, albeit, to get a boat that could be
submerged and which stood a fair chance of coming
to the surface again; so of course there was not enough
air, and the little there was was bad; the quarters, if
there were any at all, were very small and close, and
there was a deal of danger attending the most ordinary
maneuvers.</p>

<p>Now, the able-bodied seaman knew all these things
only too well, and, what was more, he had heard tall
yarns spun around of the terrors of the new and
strange craft, and these did not tend to strengthen his
desires to hurry up and enlist in that arm of the naval
service.</p>

<p>When the various governments began to take a real
interest in the submarine and to keep up an active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
flotilla, they began to realize that unless the comfort
and the safety of the men were looked after better than
they had been in the past the submarine service would
soon be shorthanded and badly crippled.</p>

<p>So as a sop for the bad conditions which the crew
must stand, the men were offered a large <i>bonus</i>—that
is, extra money besides the regular pay—and also extra
privileges. In truth, the offers were so generous and
alluring that it was not long before seafaring men began
to rush to the call, and from that time to this
there has never been the least trouble in getting crews
for undersea fighting craft.</p>

<p>As the construction of the submarine moved on
apace and it grew in size, and as new inventions and
improvements were made to supply pure air and
enough of it, all the discomforts vanished, until a
berth on an undersea craft is as agreeable, nearly, as it
is on a man-o’-war.</p>

<p><b>What the Base-Ship Is For.</b>—While, of course,
the chief object of a submarine is, as you can tell by its
very name, to travel undersea when needs be, it is, as
you have already learned, not fitted to run for more
than forty-eight hours at a stretch when totally submerged,
and as a matter of fact it spends most of its
time afloat and in the awash condition.</p>

<p>From this you will see that living on a submarine is
for the greater part of the time just about the same—though
a little more confined—as it is aboard any other
craft. Her actual cruising <i>radius</i>—that is the distance
she can sail from her base of supplies—is seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
more than 2,500 miles; and she is limited to this mileage
simply because of the lack of storage for the food
and fuel she needs.</p>

<p>For this reason every submarine must have a supply
base, and this usually is a ship which is supplied with
the necessities of life and power. The <i>base-ship</i>, as it
is called, is also a <i>floating dock</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> has a complete machine
shop, and every other conceivable thing that she
needs to take care of her flotilla of submarine children.
A <i>mother ship</i> is shown in <a href="#FIG_60">Fig. 60</a>.</p>

<p>The base-ship follows after her submarines, not
directly on their heels, but so that they will be within
easy cruising distance of her. It may seem that 2,500
miles—nearly the span of the Atlantic—is a long distance,
and it is for a submarine to make one continuous
trip; but ten short runs of 250 miles each will
use up her supplies and then she will have to return
to her base for more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="406" height="600" alt="drawing of sub leaving ship" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_60"></a>FIG. 60. THE BASE SHIP, SHOWING HOW SUBMARINES CAN ENTER BOW
FOR DRY-DOCK REPAIRS OR HIDDEN TRANSPORTATION.</div>
</div>

<p>In times of peace a submarine never strays far from
her base-ship, indeed, she spends most of her time
laying alongside of her except when at practice. At
such times the submarine and the base-ships are considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a><br /><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
<i>integral</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> parts of each other, and under these
conditions most of the crew stay aboard the ship.</p>

<p>Thus it is that a submarine sailor’s life is nearly all
spent above water, and it is not such an unhappy one
at that.</p>

<p><b>How Men Are Trained for Submarine Duty.</b>—The
base-ship is also used as a training ship for <i>rookies</i>—that
is green hands—and on it they are let into the
secrets and mysteries of the working, sailing, and fighting
machinery of the submarine.</p>

<p>The rookies are taken in hand by the officers and the
more highly skilled sailors of the submarine and drilled
in whatever they are to do until it becomes second nature
to them, for a <i>fluke</i> of any kind might spell
disaster for the whole crew and craft.</p>

<p><b>The Complement of a Submarine.</b>—The word
<i>complement</i> (notice that it is spelled with an <i>e</i> instead
of an <i>i</i>) means not some pretty bit of flattery but the
full number of men that is needed to man the boat.</p>

<p>The complement of a submarine is not very different
from that of a torpedo boat or other small naval craft.
There is, first of all, the <i>commander</i>, or <i>commanding
officer</i>, who is in charge of and is responsible for the
crew and his boat.</p>

<p>His word is law and he is as able a navigator and
<i>tactician</i>—as an expert in directing a submarine, with
skill and shrewdness is called—as it is possible to get.
His brain is the master brain of the mighty craft, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it is he who plans what his crew must do, and when
they must do it to the end that the enemy ship shall
be sunk.</p>

<p>Then there are the officers under him—<i>lieutenants</i>
(pronounced <i>lef-ten´-ants</i>, with the accent on the second
syllable, by stage folks in naval plays)—and these
correspond to the first and second mates, etc., of a
sailing ship.</p>

<p>These officers are also thoroughly competent navigators,
and should anything happen to their superior
officer, any one of them could take command of the
submarine and give a good account of himself.</p>

<p>The rest of the crew is made up of engineers and
oilers, torpedo-men and gunners, wireless and signalmen,
cooks and able-bodied seamen. The engineers
not only must know how to run the engines to get the
most power with the least fuel, but they must be machinists
of the highest class in order to make repairs
of every kind should the boat be damaged by shell
fire.</p>

<p>The torpedo-crew, as the men who have charge of
the torpedoes are called, take care of these mighty
missiles from the time they are lowered into the hull
from the base-ship to the moment they are shot from
the tubes on their courses to sink the enemy ships.</p>

<p>This crew also takes care of the trimming tanks,
which must, as we have explained before, be filled with
water to offset the effect of lightening the submarine
by the sudden discharge of the torpedoes. The gunners,
of course, look after the guns and are expert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
<i>gun pointers</i>. All of the new submarines are equipped
with <i>wireless</i> and this is worked by two or more experienced
wireless men who are on constant duty while
the boat is afloat and who operate the conductivity
telegraph system when the craft is running submerged.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CREW OF A SUBMARINE. (NOTE SAILOR GOING BELOW THROUGH HATCH IN AFTER-DECK.)</div>
</div>
<p>The submarine is kept in constant touch with the
<i>mother ship</i>, as the base-ship is sometimes called, and
as the latter has a much more powerful sending apparatus
it can, in turn, communicate with the land
either directly or by relaying the message by another
ship.</p>

<p>The wireless operators also keep busy listening for
the first faint signals sent out by enemy ships which
may come within range of their instruments, and
though they will not be able to read the messages if
they are sent in <i>cipher code</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> they can at least know of
the proximity of the ship.</p>

<p><b>Breaking in Raw Recruits.</b>—When there is peace
on earth and good will toward men the submarine
never gets very far away from its base-ship, about
its only excursions being for drill and practice, which
is made up of <i>maneuvering</i> the submarine and torpedo
practice.</p>



<p>To <i>maneuver</i> the craft means to make adroit moves
and changes of position, that is, the boat is put
from the afloat into the awash, submerged, and totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
submerged conditions by and for the benefit of
both the new men and old hands.</p>

<p>The submarine’s <i>place at sea</i>—that is, her <i>longitude</i>
and <i>latitude</i>—is found solely by <i>log distances</i> and <i>compass
courses</i> while the boat is running submerged,
and her course is corrected for <i>drift</i> and <i>leeway</i>; navigating
the submarine by these means is called <i>dead
reckoning</i>.</p>

<p>Torpedo practice consists of firing torpedoes with
<i>dummy heads</i>, that is, heads which do not contain a
charge of explosive, at floating targets which the submarine
or a lighter tows out to sea and anchors fast.
Whether the torpedoes hit or miss they come to the
surface after having been shot and are picked up again
and returned to the submarine.</p>

<p>By constant practice the men of the torpedo-crew
become highly skilled in hitting the target with the
cigar-shaped projectile, and they are not allowed to
get rusty for want of constant practice.</p>

<p>To add to the knowledge which actual practice gives
the raw recruits, as well as the more experienced men,
the officers lecture to them on every subject that has to
do with the design, construction, and operation of
every working part of the submarine.</p>

<p>In this way the crew is trained to do their several
individual duties with clock-like precision and is fit
and ready at a moment’s notice to handle the craft for
all she is worth when war comes.</p>

<p><b>The Conditions in War Time.</b>—When the dove
of peace has had its tail-feathers plucked out by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
god of war and the enemy nations are arrayed in battle
formation against each other, then the submarine
and her crew are welded into a destroying unit of the
most treacherous and dangerous kind that the sea has
ever known.</p>

<p>The conditions on board a submarine are quite different
in war time from those when the nations are at
peace. In the first place, when submarine chasers and
aircraft are scouting the seas in search of underwater
boats it is not only dangerous but often impossible for
a submarine to keep in touch with the base-ship by
wireless.</p>

<p>We say <i>dangerous</i> because wireless messages flashed
forth and back would betray its presence to an enemy
ship, and we say <i>impossible</i> in virtue of the fact that
the craft often has to run under water for as long a
time as she can stay down.</p>

<p>When cruising on the surface the sharpest lookout
must be kept every moment of the time for an enemy
ship, which may be torpedoed if it is a merchant vessel,
or the submarine must dive and get away from
it, if it should be a chaser or other kind of armed and
armored boat that is looking to sink her.</p>

<p>Under these strenuous conditions the crew is keyed
up to the highest pitch and the severest discipline is
maintained on board. Torpedoing, diving, submerging,
and all the other drills that have been learned under
the easy routine of make-believe war now become
stern realities upon which the very safety of the submarine
depends and hence the lives of the crew.</p>

<div class="faux">CHAPTER X<br />

HOW THE SUBMARINE ATTACKS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the naval powers were waking up to the fact
that the submarine was worthy of some consideration,
undersea tactics was a thing that was yet to be invented.</p>

<p>These early craft had a very short range of travel
and because of their poor construction and lack of
power they were not at all adapted for ocean-going,
hence they could not accompany the fleet of warships
on their maneuvers.</p>

<p>They were, however, thought very well of for coast
patrols, and this was the duty given them to perform;
each submarine had a stretch of coast which it was to
watch and tactics and maneuvering were not needed
for this service. Even when it was expected an attack
might be made, the only thing that was required
of them was to be on the lookout, signal the forts
on shore, dive and get out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>But as the size, range, and speed of the submarine
was increased she gradually took her place
along with the <i>auxiliary<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> craft of the fleet</i>, or <i>squadron</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and began to take part in the maneuvers
with it. It was then that certain fixed duties were
assigned to her, and her relation to the other
boats became more clearly defined and definitely
fixed.</p>

<p>As late as the Spanish-American War, and that was
only a score of years ago, the submarine played but
a sorry part. A few years later, however, when the
Russo-Japanese War was fought, the underwater
fighting craft showed for the first time in the game of
naval warfare the kind of stuff it was made of.</p>

<p>In the years of peace and prosperity that passed between
the end of the Russo-Japanese War and the beginning
of the great world war of the nations that is
now going on, the submarine was experimented with
and improved upon until it has thrown all the other
types of naval craft, from the <i>dreadnaughts</i> on down
into the shade where there isn’t any shade.</p>

<p>The result of it all is, as you probably know, that
the submarine has developed a kind of warfare all its
own and which it carries on entirely without help.
Imagine, if you can, that in the greatest war that has
ever been waged giant battleships are sewed up in the
harbors of the enemy while her submarine flotillas are
everywhere at sea and carrying on a most effective
blockade! Such is the rise of the submarine.</p>

<p><b>The Uses of the Submarine.</b>—There are two chief
uses to which the submarine is put, and these are (1)
as a <i>reserve defense</i> or <i>offense</i> for the fleet, and (2)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
as an <i>offensive weapon</i> for the purpose of maintaining
a blockade.</p>

<p><i>How She Works with the Fleet.</i>—In the first instance,
that is, where the submarine is used as a means
of defense and of offense with a fleet or squadron, her
tactics are well defined and clear-cut.</p>

<p>Her activities under these conditions are rather
limited, for she is not built speedy enough to keep
up with a swiftly steaming fleet. This, then, in the
very nature of things, keeps the submarine from playing
an otherwise all-important <i>rôle</i> of scout-ship.</p>

<p>Further, this lack of speed on her part prevents
her from engaging in battle as an actual part of the
fleet or squadron, for very often it is the speed of the
attacking men-of-war that makes for victory, and a
flotilla of submarines that lagged behind would prove
more of a hindrance than an aid.</p>

<p>But what the submarine can and does do to great
advantage is to attack an enemy fleet either as
a defensive or an offensive measure, depending on the
relative strengths of the fleets which oppose each other.</p>

<p><i>The Submarine Flotilla as a Means of Defense.</i>—Now
let us see first what happens when a fleet with a
flotilla of submarines attacks another fleet which is
without them.</p>

<p>If the attacking fleet is the weakest—that is, its guns
are the lightest—then the submarine flotilla will take
a defensive stand, though the opposing fleet is making
the attack. The submarines will lay off to the rear
of the attacking fleet, and then if the gun-fire from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
enemy waxes so warm that the attacking fleet is forced
to retire the submarines are in a good position to aid
the fleet in its retreat, as shown in <a href="#FIG_61">Fig. 61</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a href="images/i_174-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="450" height="292" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_61"></a>FIG. 61. THE SUBMARINE AS A DEFENSIVE WEAPON.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, as soon as the pursuing ships come within
range, the submarines let go their torpedoes at them
and these either blow them up, cripple them, or scare
them off. In a maneuver of this kind the commander
of the fleet executes his retreat in such a way that
the heavier-armed pursuing fleet must pass near his
submarines, which are usually submerged and are
therefore invisible.</p>

<p><i>The Submarine Flotilla as a Means of Offense.</i>—If,
now, the attacking fleet is stronger than the defensive
fleet, then the submarines of the attacking fleet
will also take an offensive part. In this case the submarines
will take up a position to the rear of the defensive
fleet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The commander of the attacking fleet will then use
such force on the enemy fleet that it will retreat along
the path where the submarines lay, when they will, of
course, torpedo them, as shown in <a href="#FIG_62">Fig. 62</a>.</p>

<p>Both these methods of attack have been used with
signal success in the war that is now going on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_62"></a>FIG. 62. THE SUBMARINE AS AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON.</div>
</div>

<p><b>The Submarine as a Scout.</b>—Although the submarine
is useless as a scout for a swiftly moving fleet
still it can render great service as a scout on its own
hook.</p>

<p>By way of illustration let us suppose that the enemy
has a harbor that is well protected by forts and guns,
that her fleet is laying to in it, that we want to know
how many ships the fleet is made up of, and, finally,
what class of ships they belong to.</p>

<p>It is the duty then of a submarine to get into the
harbor and take a general survey of the situation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
You may wonder how the craft is to do this, since the
harbor is mined; but by skilful handling, the captain
will usually get through safely, find out all that he
wants to know and run out again.</p>

<p>Besides thoroughly reconnoitering a harbor, the submarine
can lay a few contact mines, as we explained in
a chapter that has gone before, in positions of which
the enemy fleet is in entire ignorance and which will
be more than likely to result in the destruction of at
least a part of the fleet.</p>

<p>Further, the submarine is used to destroy fields of
mines which have been laid by the enemy in a harbor.
This is done by mines thrown from the torpedo tubes
among those that have been planted and which explode
by the concussion.</p>

<p><b>The Submarine as a Blockader.</b>—The most important
use to which the submarine has ever been put
and one that was never thought of seriously until the
present conflict is that of a <i>blockader</i>.</p>

<p>Ever since the beginning of this war Germany has
realized the tremendous need of keeping the <i>neutral</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
countries from supplying the Allies with munitions
and food supplies, and she has prepared for years a
blockade of a new and very effective kind, and this
is by destroying merchantmen by submarines.</p>

<p>England and the other Allies have done the same
thing with the Central Powers—which is not a very
hard thing to do because Germany’s fleet of warships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
is cooped up in her various ports and dare not venture
forth, and so the task is left entirely to her submarine
flotilla.</p>

<p>And what makes it still harder for the German submarines
is that the Allies keep on the constant watch
for these enemy undersea craft, and this they do with
their <i>submarine destroyers</i>, and the United States is
after them with her <i>submarine chasers</i>, to say nothing
of England’s aircraft attacks.</p>

<p>Altogether it is very hard for the enemy submarines
to keep in touch with their respective bases or to receive
orders as to their courses of action. When on
blockade duty, then, the captain of a submarine is in
very truth, the commander of his craft and it is
strictly up to him to determine what her tactics shall
be.</p>

<p>As long as he does his work well, which means that
he sinks a fair number of all the ships that enter his
zone, his superior officer, wherever he is, will have no
quarrel with him as to when or how he does the work.</p>

<p>So you see the tactics used by the captain of a submarine
while doing this kind of work depend entirely on
the conditions he encounters at the moment, and on
the quick decision and judgment of the captain depends
the success or failure of the attack.</p>

<p><b>How a Submarine Attacks a Merchantman.</b>—As
a general thing submarines travel alone when merchantmen
are to be torpedoed.</p>

<p>The sea is mapped out into <i>zones</i>, as certain areas
or parts of the sea are called, and each zone, or part, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
usually assigned to a single craft; the submarine patrols
this zone constantly, and the captain and his officers
keep their weather eye open for passing merchantmen
or vessels which might in any way aid or
carry supplies to the enemy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">

<div class="attrib"><i>Courtesy of Leslie’s Weekly</i></div>

<div class="caption">A GERMAN U-BOAT “BREAKING WATER” PREPARATORY TO EXAMINING
THE CARGO OF AN ENEMY SHIP</div>
</div>

<p>To do this the captain of the submarine stops every
ship that comes his way and has her papers and cargo
examined, and in this way finds out whether the ship
is what she seems to be or if she carries <i>contraband</i>—that
is arms, ammunition, and war supplies of any
kind—or not.</p>

<p>The way in which this interesting procedure is done
is as follows:</p>

<p>The submarine, let us say, has sighted a ship, and
seeing that it is to all intents an unarmed merchantman
she rises to the surface and trains her rapid-fire guns
on the craft. Next she signals the ship to stand by and
at the same time she runs toward her.</p>

<p>Now the captain of the ship has three courses open
to him: (1) to put on full speed and try to get away,
trusting to luck to prevent his craft from being shot
full of holes or torpedoed; (2) to take a still greater
chance and try to ram the submarine with the sharp,
steel-shod bow of his ship and so either disable or
sink her, and (3) to comply gracefully to the request
and heave to.</p>

<p>If the latter is done, the <i>collapsible boat</i> of the submarine
is rigged up and a couple of the officers and
crew row over to the ship, when they are hauled aboard
and go through her. Should they find nothing of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
suspicious or contraband nature, the boat returns to
the submarine and the ship is allowed to go her way.</p>



<p>But, on the other hand, if contraband is found on
board, the captain of the submarine will do one of
these two things: (1) he will warn the crew of the
enemy ship that he is either going to open fire on her
with his guns or torpedo her, and to take to the life-boats,
or (2) he will sink her without warning if the
whim so seizes him. Often the captain of the destroyed
craft is taken aboard the submarine and held as a
hostage.</p>

<p><b>When Submarines Attack in Pairs.</b>—Another
strategic scheme that is used to torpedo enemy craft is
to work submarines in pairs.</p>

<p>This is not done, as a rule, except where the ships
may, in virtue of their armament, prove dangerous to
a single submarine and then they are sunk without
warning.</p>

<p>Tactics of two different kinds are used in the actual
stopping of the craft. The first is for the submarines
to lay off from each other at a distance of from three
to five miles (as shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>). Then when
the submarine, with her periscope above water, spots
an enemy ship, she signals to the other submarine,
which is submerged, and gives her the exact speed and
course of the armed vessel.</p>

<p>The submarine with her periscope above water cannot
be seen by the ship because she is too far off, and
the nearby submarine cannot be seen because she is totally
submerged; so the first submarine directs the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
submarine how to train her torpedo tubes on the
enemy ship and when to shoot the torpedoes at her.
By these tactics a ship can be sunk without either of
the submarines being seen.</p>

<p>The other and second way by which an armed ship
can be attacked is by having a pair of submarines
travel together, one directly over and separated from
the other by a distance of only twenty or thirty feet (as
shown in <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<a href="images/i_180-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="460" height="259" alt="diagram" /></a>
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_63"></a>FIG. 63. A, B, HOW THE SUBMARINES TRAVEL IN PAIRS.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, when a ship is sighted by the craft nearest the
surface she comes up boldly and demands the hostile
vessel to heave to. Should, instead, the enemy ship
open fire and cripple or destroy the submarine, the submerged
submarine takes up the fight and shoots a couple
of torpedoes at the aggressive ship and so puts an
end to her, if possible.</p>

<p>The tactics we have told you about are only a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the many used by present-day submarines; we
should like to go on and write a book about them but if
we did we’re afraid the Imperial German Government
might not like it, so we’ll stop here.</p>

THE NEW SUBMARINE CHASERS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the boast of Germany that she will win the
present war by sinking not only all of the ships of the
Allies, but those of any other country which may trade
with them.</p>

<p>Now, the United States demands the freedom of the
seas for every American citizen and for every ship
that flies the stars and stripes and to make good this
demand is what brought us into the war.</p>

<p>If Germany could destroy all of the merchantmen of
the Allies—and we are now one of them—as she wants
to do, she would doubtless be the victor. She hopes
to but will never be. The blockade by her submarines
is growing more and more serious and many plans
and schemes have been put forth to outwit, offset, or
to break it down by destroying her destroyers.</p>

<p>There are at the present time<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> only about thirty
million tons of <i>shipping</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in the world which can be
used to supply the Allies of Europe with munitions of
war. The German U-boats are picking off ships, both
neutral and otherwise at the rate of half a million tons
a month, and at this rate of destruction shipping cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
last more than a few years. Hence the great need
of breaking the blockade and of doing it quickly.</p>

<p><b>Schemes for Outwitting the Submarine.</b>—Many
plans have been thought of and tried out to get the best
of the tough old submarine and so defeat it; and among
these are:</p>

<p>(1) To build ships that are so heavily armored that
they can withstand the attack of torpedoes.</p>

<p>(2) To build ships which have a light enough
<i>draft</i> and are speedy enough to outdodge and to outrun
the swift torpedo.</p>

<p>(3) To outrig the ships below the water-line with
nets which prevent the torpedoes from striking the
hulls hard enough to explode them.</p>

<p>(4) To fit the ships with wireless ears which will
detect the presence and determine the position of the
submarine before it gets within torpedoing range and
so give them a chance to escape.</p>

<p>(5) Any number of other impracticable schemes.</p>

<p>Now, you may ask why these schemes are useless.
Among the reasons are these, (a) steel armor has
yet to be made that will withstand the violent explosive
power of the torpedo, (b) ships with a draft light
enough and a speed great enough to get out of the
way of a torpedo could not be used as freighters,
(c) nets on ships make them slow and unwieldy,
and as soon as they were used the torpedoes were
fitted with steel cutters which enabled them to go
through as easily as before, (d) the art of wireless
has not yet advanced to the point where it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for a ship to detect the presence and position of a
submerged submarine, (e) every other scheme that
has been put to the acid test has had a glaring fault
in it.</p>

<p><b>Plans for Destroying the U-Boats.</b>—Now, the
right way to break the German blockade is to destroy
the U-boats, and plans along this line have been
devised and carried out with better success.</p>

<p>The submarine can be destroyed in several ways.
Among the most important are (1) by laying mine-fields;
(2) by arming merchantmen with rapid-fire
guns; (3) by destroying the base-ships which mother
the submarines; (4) by hunting them down with submarine
chasers, and (5) by dropping bombs or shelling
them from aircraft.</p>

<p><i>Laying Mine Fields in Harbors.</i>—This plan is very
good for protecting harbors against submarine attacks;
but as nearly all the merchantmen are sunk
from 200 to 300 miles off the coast, the use of mines
for the protection of shipping is very limited.</p>

<p><i>Arming Merchantmen with Guns.</i>—Arming merchantmen
has met with some success, but as a matter
of fact it is a very uncertain means of protection, and
the large number of armed ships which are sunk
weekly shows that the plan is weak.</p>

<p>As a merchantman, or freighter, is usually a slow
craft, and a submarine can easily out-maneuver it
even when the submarine is on the surface, and when
she is submerged she cannot be seen, it must be clear
that ordinary rapid-fire guns cannot easily hit her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">THREE EIGHTY-FOOT GASOLENE CHASERS ON THEIR WAY TO PATROL DUTY</div>
</div>

<p><i>Destroying the Mother Ships.</i>—To destroy the base-ships
is, though it may sound like a <i>paradox</i>, one of
the best and at the same time one of the least practical
plans of getting rid of the submarines that infest
a certain zone.</p>

<p>It must be clear if the base-ships are destroyed that
the submarines they mother would speedily come to an
end. Knowing full well that the Allies would try to
find out her bases, both on land and sea, Germany has
hidden most of them well, and those that are not hidden
are protected by guns of such caliber<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> as to prove
a source of danger to even a fleet of first line dreadnaughts.</p>

<p>Since the bases are too hard to find and too hard
to destroy when once found, other easier and more
practical plans have been devised, tried and found
fairly successful.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Submarine Chasers.</b>—And now we come
to a class of naval craft to which the name <i>submarine
chaser</i> has been given, and she has proved to be the
best and most practical plan yet worked out to kill
off the submarine.</p>

<p>There are two very different kinds of submarine
chasers, and these are (1) boats which travel on the
surface of the water, and (2) craft which travel
through the air. The first kind only, though, is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a <i>submarine chaser</i>, while the second kind may be
either a <i>dirigible balloon</i> or a <i>warplane</i>.</p>



<p><i>The 80-Foot Submarine Chaser.</i>—The submarine
chaser is simply a boat whose success as a destroyer
depends on four <i>factors</i>, and these are (a) how fast
she can go; (b) how light her draft is; (c) how well
she is armed, and (d) how fast she can be built.</p>

<p>Two kinds of these chasers have been built, and
both have shown their real worth. The first is known
as the 80-foot submarine chaser. 550 of these noble
craft have already been built for England and sent
over to operate against the U-boat in British waters.</p>

<p>They are powered with gasoline engines and are
built just about like the high-speed pleasure boats that
are now so common here on this side of the Atlantic,
that is, they have a three-quarter cruising cabin and
cockpit as shown in <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="600" height="266" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_64"></a>FIG. 64. EIGHTY-FOOT GASOLINE SUBMARINE CHASER.</div>
</div>

<p>They are very seaworthy, and the powerful gasoline
engines installed in them give them speed enough
to outrun the fastest submarines that have yet been
built. Each one carries a rapid-fire gun of the 3-inch
type.</p>

<p><i>The 110-Foot Submarine Chaser.</i>—The only fault
with the 80-footer is that its small size makes it impossible
to store away enough fuel to give it a large
cruising radius, and so a new type of submarine chaser
is being built which is 110 feet long. Its general
appearance is shown in <a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_191.jpg" width="600" height="226" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_65"></a>FIG. 65. 110-FOOT STEAM SUBMARINE CHASER.</div>
</div>

<p>This boat is powered with steam engines and oil-burning
boilers which drive the chaser at the very fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a><br /><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a><br /><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
speed of 25 knots. The craft is armed with a battery
of two 3-inch guns mounted on the fore and aft
decks. The large size of this chaser makes it easy for
it to cruise for long distances, while its speed is 8
knots faster than that of the fleetest submarine and
this makes it a foe that is truly to be feared.</p>

<p><b>How the Chaser Chases a Submarine.</b>—The way
a submarine chaser chases a submarine is like this:
each chaser is given a certain area of seaway to
patrol. This she does, and if she is lucky she will soon
see the periscope of an enemy submarine poking its
hood above the water to take a peek around the horizon.</p>

<p>This is the signal for the chaser to bear down on
that periscope at full speed, the gunners doing their
level best to hit the periscope or any other part of
the submarine which shows itself above water.</p>

<p>As it takes time for the submarine to dive or to
get her own guns into action, the chaser stands a pretty
good chance of either crippling or even sinking her.
Further, the submarine cannot use her torpedoes on
the chaser, for the latter craft is so short and has
such a shallow draft that her hull does not offer much
of a target for a torpedo, even though she were standing
still, and much less when she is bearing down on
the submarine at full speed.</p>

<p>Every once in a while a chaser is able to surprise a
submarine when she has come to the surface for a
breather and to recharge her storage batteries. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
this happens it is simply another case of the cat eating
the canary.</p>

<p>If the submarine is within two miles of the chaser
she cannot get ready to dive and she must either get
her own guns in action or else she must try to outrun
the chaser, getting ready to dive as she runs and
trusting to the Kaiser that she may not be hit in the
meantime.</p>

<p>This last course proves disastrous to the submarine
nine times out of ten, and so she usually
gets her guns into action and a regular little sea battle
is fought right then and there.</p>

<p><b>Shooting the Guns of the Chaser.</b>—Having
found, chased, and caught the submarine, the next
thing to do is to put her out of commission. On the
guns with which the chaser is armed, and on her gunners,
depend to a large extent the success or the failure
of the attack.</p>

<p>A gun which had a long range and a <i>flat trajectory</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
was quick in action, and rapid-firing, was thought to
be all that a gun should be for submarine execution;
and it was all right for shooting at conning towers
and similar targets which showed themselves above
the water-line, but it was useless for a gun of this
kind to try to hit anything that was even a few feet
under water.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are somewhat deep and scientific
but if you will read carefully, look at the diagrams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
shown in <a href="#FIG_66">Figs. 66</a> and <a href="#FIG_67">67</a>, and do a little thinking
as you go along you will be able to <i>visualize</i> the
whole thing—that is, to see it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_194a.jpg" width="600" height="153" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_66"></a>FIG. 66. HOW A FLAT TRAJECTORY AFFECTS THE PROJECTILE.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, the way this gun was made was to <i>rifle</i> the
barrel of it, and this gave a turning motion to the projectile
when it was fired, that is, it spun around on its
<i>long axis</i>, and the <i>trajectory was flat</i>, which means
that the path of the projectile in its flight from the
gun to its target was only slightly curved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_194b.jpg" width="600" height="196" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_67"></a>FIG. 67. HOW A BOW TRAJECTORY AFFECTS THE PROJECTILE.</div>
</div>

<p>Both of these things made the projectile deviate
from its course the instant it struck the water, or
<i>ricochet</i> (pronounced rik-o-sháy) as it is called; that
is, it bounced from the water in exactly the same
way that a flat stone skips along when you throw
it close to the surface of a pond or lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The right kind of gun to use on submarine chasers
is not rifled, and the projectile should be given a
trajectory, or path, that is much the same as that of
an arrow; the result is that a shot can be fired at a
submarine which is submerged to a depth of 20 feet or
so and be effective because the curve of the path is
such that the projectile drops straight, or nearly
straight, down on the submarine and penetrates the
water as shown in <a href="#FIG_67">Fig. 67</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 227px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_68"></a>FIG. 68. HOW AIR CRAFT CAN SPOT A SUBMERGED SUBMARINE.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Submarine Air Chasers.</b>—Besides the submarine
chasers just described, there are two other kinds that
have shown great possibilities as destroyers of undersea
craft. These are (1) the <i>airship</i>, or dirigible balloon,
and (2) the <i>airplane</i>, and it is more than likely
that in the near future, should the war keep on, the
latter craft alone will be used for submarine chasers.</p>

<p>Where a boat chaser cannot see a submarine at all
when she is submerged, an airplane can fly directly
over her, follow her every movement, and see her
when she is at a considerable depth. (See <a href="#FIG_68">Fig. 68</a>.)</p>



<p>As the airplane is much more steady in the air
than a submarine is on the water and as the former
is much quicker and speedier than the latter, a battle
between these two very different kinds of craft is
an unequal one with the odds greatly in favor of the
warplane.</p>

<p><b>A Way to Lift the U-Boat Blockade.</b>—Here,
then, is a real, ready way that the submarine can
be destroyed and Germany’s blockade lifted. To put
an end quickly and for all time to the U-boat menace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the United States ought to build several thousand airplanes
at once and arm these with bombs and rapid-fire
guns like the Lewis<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and send this fleet to patrol the
seas.</p>



<p>If this were done there wouldn’t be enough U-boats
left in a month’s time to flag a Norwegian fishing
trawler. So the thing for your Uncle Sammy to do
is to build a great fleet of airplanes, and in the shortest
possible time.</p>

<p>There is still another way to break the blockade, and
this will be described in the next chapter.</p>

THE LAST WORD IN SUBMARINES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is less than twenty years agone that the first five
baby Hollands were built in this country for, and
delivered to, England, and from that time dates the
beginning of the art of modern submarine construction.</p>

<p>Since then the size, speed, and cruising radius of
each succeeding type of submarine has grown greater
and ever greater, until from a craft hardly larger
than a power pleasure boat there has been evolved
a truly wonderful undersea vessel of magnificent proportions.</p>

<p><b>Uncle Sam’s Latest Submarines.</b>—The result of
this marvelous development is that the latest of Uncle
Sam’s submarines are of the 1200 and 1500 tons <i>displacement</i>
type and they have a speed of 21 knots on
the surface.</p>

<p>These giant submarines have a cruising radius of
about 4,000 miles and are fitted with every instrument,
device, apparatus and machine that human ingenuity
can think of, or at least that has been invented,
which goes to make for their operating and fighting
qualities and for the safety and comfort of their
crews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>From this you will see that since the year of 1900
the size of these craft has been increased about four
times, their speed doubled, and their efficiency raised
to half again as much. Based on the rapid strides
that have been made since the war has been going on,
it does not take any great foresight to predict that
in the near future, if the U-boat blockade is not
broken, submarines of upwards of 500 feet in length
and 10,000 tons’ displacement will form the merchant
fleet of the United States.</p>

<p><b>The Great Blockades of the Warring Nations.</b>—The
great blockades by which the Allies have bottled
up the German Empire by their superior naval forces,
and by which Germany is trying to shut off the trading
of other countries with the Allies by her U-boat
warfare, have prevented either side from scoring a
victory.</p>

<p>But with Germany’s usual dogged determination
for overcoming the difficulties that beset her, she built
a submarine which could travel without a <i>convoy</i>,
that is, without any base-ship to go along with her
to provision and supply her needs, for 5,000 miles
at least.</p>

<p>This giant submarine carried a cargo worth a million
dollars or more, sunk out of sight as she left her
home port, slipped underneath the grim warships of
the Allies which menaced German shipping, and in
this way ran the blockade.</p>

<p>Then one fine day there bobbed up in American
waters near Chesapeake Bay a monster merchant submarine—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
largest underwater craft ever built and
the first of her kind ever seen. She was in very truth
a nine days’ wonder.</p>

<p><b>The First of the Merchant Submarines.</b>—The
<i>Deutschland</i>, as she was named, was a marvel of engineering
skill, and she was hailed as the first of a
great fleet of merchant submarines which was to
break the Allies’ blockade.</p>

<p>Starting from Bremen, Germany, and traveling underwater
through the English Channel for a distance
of 90 miles without even once coming to the surface,
she made the entire voyage without mishap and
docked at Baltimore just 16 days later.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="FIG_69"></a>FIG. 69. THE MERCHANT SUBMARINE DEUTSCHLAND.</div>
</div>

<p>When you think of how carefully she had to be
handled and how cautiously she had to proceed so
that she might escape destruction at the hands of her
surface enemies, you must admit that she made the
run in really remarkable time.</p>

<p><b>Some Facts About the Deutschland.</b>—This great
merchant submarine is 315 feet long, 30 feet through
the beam, and <i>draws</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> 17 feet of water. She is,
therefore, as large as many of our coastwise steamers,
so that she is something more than a mere underwater
boat—indeed, she is a veritable submarine <i>ship</i>.</p>

<p>Her hull is shaped more nearly like that of a real
ship than any submarine craft that was ever built
before her, as <a href="#FIG_69">Fig. 69</a> shows; but she has a conning
tower, periscopes and wireless masts like any of the
other of the tribe of submarines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Her wireless aerial is held in place between two
steel masts, each of which is 50 feet high and both of
which can be folded down on the deck. The mast on
her for’ard deck is fitted with a <i>crow’s nest</i> for a
<i>lookout</i>, as though she were a real ship.</p>

<p><i>Her Captain and His Crew.</i>—The inside of her hull
is very much like an ordinary merchantman. For’ard
are large and comfortable quarters for the officers, of
whom there are nine, including Captain Koenig—a
man you can’t help but admire. Abaft the ship are
the quarters for the crew, and both fore and aft in
her hold are compartments for the cargo she carries.</p>

<p><i>Her Valuable Cargo.</i>—In making her first trip
over from Bremen her cargo consisted of dyestuffs,
medicines, <i>synthetic stones</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and other merchandise
which took up small storage room and yet which was
very valuable.</p>

<p>These she unloaded in Baltimore, and her return
cargo was made up of crude rubber, tin, and nickel—materials
much needed by the German Government
for purposes of warfare.</p>

<p>She also served the very useful purpose of a <i>packet</i>,
for by means of her Captain Koenig was able to
hand personally to Count von Bernstorff, the German
Ambassador to the United States at that time, important
instructions which would otherwise have been
hard to get through.</p>

<p>Again, what was of even greater urgency was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the Count was able to get rid of certain documents
which would have made matters quite uncomfortable
for him if they had been found in his possession some
months later when the break came between the United
States and Germany.</p>

<p><i>Her Great Engines.</i>—The <i>Deutschland</i> is driven by
two 600-horsepower Diesel engines, each of which has
four cylinders. She is able to make a speed of 14
knots on the surface, but when submerged her speed
is only about half as much.</p>

<p>She is supplied with enough liquid fuel and solid
foods to enable her to cruise for 5,000 miles without
making port.</p>

<p>Such is the <i>Deutschland</i>, and to her belongs the
distinction of being the first underwater merchantman.
Under the skilful command of her captain, she
served her country nobly and well for the purpose for
which she was built.</p>

<p><b>How the United States Can Break the Blockade.</b>—Right
now the United States and the Allies have
to face the same gigantic problem that was forced
upon Germany at the beginning of the war, and that
is to break the enemy’s blockade.</p>

<p>The scheme of keeping the sea-roads clear for shipping
by destroying the U-boats has proved a slow and
hard process, and so new plans have been mapped out
by our naval engineers and others with which to defeat
the blockade.</p>

<p><i>The Wooden Ship Idea.</i>—The first plan, and one
which is being carried out with great energy, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
building of hundreds of little wooden ships, each of
which is 25 feet shorter than the <i>Deutschland</i> and has
a cargo carrying capacity of 3,500 tons, and a speed
of 4 knots less than the surface speed of the great
German submarine.</p>

<p>The main idea seems to be to turn these little boats
out fast enough so that the number the U-boats sink
will be so small that the loss will not be felt. The
glaring fault of this idea is that while the U-boats are
sinking 500,000 tons of shipping a month, American
ship-builders can build only 200,000 tons a month, and
this is figuring it out with a liberal margin.</p>

<p>While these small wooden craft of the vintage of
1850 would relieve the stress that is now felt in shipping
circles they would not by any means remove it.</p>

<p><i>The Submarine Plan.</i>—Simon Lake, the inventor of
the submersible, has enlarged upon the German plan,
and his plan is one which our Government ought to
carry out, because, in the humble opinion of the
writer, it is the only feasible one thus far advanced.</p>

<p>Mr. Lake has organized a company to build a fleet
of undersea merchantmen, each boat of which will be
ten times as large as the <i>Deutschland</i> and can carry a
cargo of 7,500 tons. Mr. Lake says that with the
co-operation of the Government he can build 100 of
these giant craft in the first year, and that at the
end of three years he can have a fleet of 500 of
them built and in service. That is to say, in this
short time he can have 4,000,000 tons of cargo sailing
the seas with absolute safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>This plan of the great submarine builder is the
key which will unlock the horns of our dilemma. The
only drawback seems to be the ability of a company to
turn out so complex a mechanism as the submarine,
and of such an enormous size, fast enough to make up
for the rapidly disappearing tonnage of the Allies.</p>

<p>In the meantime the submarine chasers and the
wooden and steel ships that are now being built may
help to some extent to take care of our shipping until
the great commercial submarines of Lake can be built
and put into the trans-Atlantic service.</p>

<p><b>When Submarine Meets Submarine.</b>—When
Greek meets Greek then comes the tug of war, so the
old saw goes, and it is just as true that the way to
break the blockade of the U-boats is to pit the cunning
of submarines against them.</p>

<p>With all our shipping going by the undersea route,
the U-boats will lose their sting, the blockade will be
broken, the power of the Allies will outweigh that of
Germany, and the war will speedily come to an end.</p>

<p>And may that time come soon!</p>
